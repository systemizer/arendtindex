original meaning: a life devoted to public-political matters .", " 3 Aristotle distinguished three ways of life ( bioi ) which men might choose in freedom, that is, in full independence of the necessities of life and the relationships they originated.", " This prerequisite of freedom ruled out all ways of life chiefly devoted to keeping one\u2019s self alive \u2014 not only labor, which was

sufficient dignity to constitute a bios at all, an autonomous and authentically human way of life; since they served and produced what was necessary and useful, they could not be free, independent of human needs and wants .", " 6 That the political way of life escaped this verdict is due to the Greek understanding of polls life, which to them denoted a very special and freely chosen form of political organization and by no means just any form of action necessary to keep men together in an orderly fashion.", " Not that the Greeks or Aristotle were ignorant of the fact that human life

breathless abstention from external physical movement and activity of every kind, is more decisive than the distinction between the political and the theoretical way of life, because it can eventually be found within each of the three ways of life.", " It is like the distinction between war and peace: just as war takes place for the sake of peace, thus every kind of activity, even the processes of mere thought, must culminate in the absolute quiet of contemplation .", " 11 Every movement, the movements of body and soul as well as of speech and reasoning, must cease before truth.", " Truth, be

therefore, the term vita activa receives its meaning from the vita contemplativa ; its very restricted dignity is bestowed upon it because it serves the needs and wants of contemplation in a living body .", " 13 Christianity, with its belief in a hereafter whose joys announce themselves in the delights of contemplation , 14 conferred a religious sanction upon the abasement of the vita activa to its derivative, secondary position; but the determination of the order itself coincided with the very discovery of contemplation (theoria) as a human faculty, distinctly different from thought and reasoning, which occurred in the Socratic school and from then on has ruled metaphysical and political thought throughout our tradition .", " 16 It seems unnecessary to my present purpose to discuss the reasons for this tradition.", " Obviously they are deeper than the historical occasion which gave rise to the conflict between the polls and the philosopher and thereby, almost incidentally, also led to the discovery of contemplation as the philosopher\u2019s way of life.", " They must lie in an altogether different aspect of the human condition, whose diversity is not exhausted in the various

revelation and therefore something essentially given to man, or that I prefer the modern age\u2019s pragmatic assertion that man can know only what he makes himself.", " My contention is simply that the enormous weight of contemplation in the traditional hierarchy has blurred the distinctions and articulations within the vita activa itself and that, appearances notwithstanding, this condition has not been changed essentially by the modern break with the tradition and the eventual reversal of its hierarchical order in Marx and Nietzsche.", " It lies in the very nature of the famous \u201cturning upside down\u201d of philosophic systems or currently accepted values, that is, in the nature of the operation itself, that the conceptual framework is left more or less intact.", " The modern reversal shares with the traditional hierarchy the assumption that the same central human preoccupation must prevail in all activities of men, since without one comprehensive principle no order could be established.", " This assumption is not a matter of course, and my use of the term vita activa presupposes that the concern underlying all its activities is not the same as and is neither superior nor inferior to the central concern of the vita contemplativa.", " 3 ETERNITY VERSUS IMMORTALITY That the various modes of active engagement in the things of this world, on one side, and pure thought culminating in contemplation, on the other, might correspond to two altogether different central human concerns has in one way or another been manifest ever since \u201cthe men of thought and

they assumed at once, not that they had found something different in addition to what was already known, but that they had found a higher principle to replace the principle that ruled the polis.", " The shortest, albeit somewhat superficial, way to indicate these two different and to an extent even conflicting principles is to recall the distinction between immortality and eternity.", " Immortality means endurance in time, deathless life on this earth and in this world as it was given, according to Greek understanding, to nature and the Olympian gods.", " Against this background of

gods but not under the rule of an eternal God.", " If we trust Herodotus, the difference between the two seems to have been striking to Greek self-understanding prior to the conceptual articulation of the philosophers, and therefore prior to the specifically Greek experiences of the eternal which underlie this articulation.", " Herodotus, discussing Asiatic forms of worship and beliefs in an invisible God, mentions explicitly that compared with this transcendent God (as we would say today) who is beyond time and life and the universe, the Greek gods are anthropophyeis, have the same nature, not simply the same shape, as man .", " 17 The Greeks\u2019 concern with immortality grew out of their experience of an immortal nature and immortal gods which together surrounded the individual lives of mortal men.", " Imbedded in a cosmos where everything was immortal, mortality became the hallmark of human existence.", " Men are \u201cthe mortals,\u201d the only mortal things in

we may add, that gods and men have the same nature.", " See also Pindar Carmina Nemaea vi.", " whose immortal life is guaranteed through procreation.", " 18 The mortality of men lies in the fact that

in a cyclical order.", " 1 he task and potential greatness of mortals lie in their ability to produce things\u2014 works and deeds and words 19 \u2014 which would deserve to be and, at least to a degree, are at home in everlastingness, so that through them mortals could find their place in a cosmos where everything is immortal except themselves.", " By their capacity for the immortal deed, by their ability to leave nonperishable traces behind, men, their individual mortality notwithstanding, attain an immortality of their own and prove themselves to be of a \u201cdivine\u201d nature.", " The distinction between man and animal runs right through the human species itself: only the best ( aristoi ), who constantly prove themselves to be the best ( aristeu ein, a verb for which there is no equivalent in any other language) and who \u201cprefer immortal fame to mortal things,\u201d are really human; the others, content with whatever pleasures nature will yield them, live and die like

cared to write down his thoughts; for it is obvious that, no matter how concerned a thinker may be with eternity, the moment he sits down to write his thoughts he ceases to be concerned primarily with eternity and shifts his attention to leaving some trace of them.", " He has entered the vita activa and chosen its way of permanence and potential immortality.", " One thing is certain: it is only in Plato that concern with the eternal and the life of the philosopher are seen as inherently contradictory and in conflict with the striving for immortality, the way of life of the citizen, the bios politikos.", " The philosopher\u2019s experience of the eternal, which to Plato was arrheton (\u201cunspeakable\u201d), and to Aristotle aneu logon (\u201cwithout word\u201d), and which later was conceptualized in the paradoxical nunc stans (\u201cthe standing now\u201d), can occur only outside the realm of human affairs and outside the plurality of men, as we know from the Cave parable in Plato\u2019s Republic , where the philosopher, having liberated himself from the fetters that bound him to his fellow men, leaves the cave in perfect \u201csingularity,\u201d as it were, neither accompanied nor followed by others.", " Politically speaking, if to die is the same as \u201cto cease to be among men,\u201d experience of the eternal is a kind of death, and the only thing that separates it from real death is that it is not final because no living creature can endure it for any length of time.", " And this is precisely what separates the vita contemplativa from the vita activa in medieval thought .", " 21 Yet it is decisive that the experience of the eternal, in contradistinction to that of the immortal, has no correspondence with and cannot be transformed into any activity whatsoever, since even the activity of thought, which goes on within one\u2019s self by means of words, is obviously not only inadequate to render it but would interrupt and ruin the experience itself.", " Theoria, or \u201ccontemplation,\u201d is the word given to the experience of the eternal, as distinguished from all other attitudes, which at 21.", " In vita activa fixi permanere possumus; in contemplativa autem intenta mente manere nullo modo valemus (Aquinas Summa theologica ii.", " 2.", " 181.", "4).", " most may pertain to immortality.", " It may be that the philosophers\u2019 discovery of the eternal was helped by their very justified doubt of the chances of the polls for immortality or even permanence, and it may be that the shock of this discovery was so overwhelming that they could not but look down upon all striving for immortality as vanity and vainglory, certainly placing themselves thereby into open opposition to the ancient city-state and the religion which inspired it.", " However, the eventual victory of the concern with eternity over all kinds of aspirations toward immortality is not due to philosophic thought.", " The fall of the Roman Empire plainly demonstrated that no work of mortal hands can be immortal, and it was accompanied by the rise of the Christian gospel of an everlasting individual life to its position as the exclusive religion of Western mankind.", " Both together made any striving for an earthly immortality futile and unnecessary.", " And they succeeded so well in making the vita activa and the bios politikos the handmaidens of contemplation that not even the rise of the secular in the modern age and the concomitant reversal of the traditional hierarchy between action and contemplation sufficed to save from oblivion the striving for immortality which originally had been the spring and center of the vita activa.", " CHAPTER II The Public and the Private Realm 4 MAN : A SOCIAL OR A POLITICAL ANIMAL The vita activa, human life in so far as it is actively engaged in doing something, is always rooted in a world of men and of manmade things which it never leaves or altogether transcends.", " Things and men form the environment for each of man\u2019s activities, which would be pointless without such location; yet this environment, the world into which we are born, would not exist without the human activity which produced it, as in the case of fabricated things; which takes care of it, as in the case of cultivated land; or which established it through organization, as in the case of the body politic.", " No human life, not even the life of the hermit in nature\u2019s wilderness, is possible without a world which directly or indirectly testifies to the presence of other human beings.", " All human activities are conditioned by the fact that men live together, but it is only action that cannot even be imagined outside the society of men.", " The activity of labor does not need the presence of others, though a being laboring in complete solitude would not be human but an animal laborans in the word\u2019s most literal significance.", " Man working and fabricating and building a world inhabited only by himself would still be a fabricator, though not homo faber: he would have lost his specifically human quality and, rather, be a god \u2014 not, to be sure, the Creator, but a divine demiurge as Plato described him in one of his myths.", " Action alone is the exclusive prerogative of man; neither a beast nor a god The Public and the Private Realm is capable of it, 1 and only action is entirely dependent upon the constant presence of others.", " This special relationship between action and being together seems fully to justify the early translation of Aristotle\u2019s zoonpolitikon by animal socialis, already found in Seneca, which then became the standard translation through Thomas Aquinas: homo est naturaliter politicus, id est, socialis (\u201cman is by nature political, that is, social\u201d) .", " 2 More than any elaborate theory, this unconscious substitution of the social for the political betrays the extent to which the original Greek understanding of politics had been lost.", " For this, it is significant but not decisive that the word \u201csocial\u201d is Roman in origin and has no equivalent in Greek language or thought.", " Yet the Latin usage of the word societas also originally had a clear, though limited, political meaning; it indicated an alliance between people for a specific purpose, as when men organize in order to rule others or to commit a crime.", " 3 It is only with the later 1.", " It seems quite striking that the Homeric gods act only with respect to men, ruling them from afar or interfering in their affairs.", " Conflicts

act together, but the scene is set by the mortals, even when the decision is arrived at in the assembly of gods on Olympus.", " I think such a \u201cco-operation\u201d is indicated in the Homeric

outside the company of men, but they did not count this condition among the specifically human characteristics; on the contrary, it was something human life had in common with animal life, and for this reason alone it could not be fundamentally human.", " The natural, merely social companionship of the human species was considered to be a limitation imposed upon us by the needs of biological life, which are the same for the human animal as for other forms of animal life.", " According to Greek thought, the human capacity for political organization is not only different from but stands in direct opposition to that natural association whose center is the home ( oikia ) and the family.", " The rise of the city-state meant that man received \u201cbesides his private life a sort of second

everything merely necessary or useful is strictly excluded.", " However, while certainly only the foundation of the city-state enabled men to spend their whole lives in the political realm, in action and speech, the conviction that these two human capacities belonged together and are the highest of all seems to have preceded the polis and was already present in pre-Socratic thought.", " The stature of the Homeric Achilles can be understood only if one sees him as \u201cthe doer of great deeds and the speaker of great words .", "\u201d 7 In distinction from modern understanding, such

logoi) with which to reply to striking blows that will eventually teach thought in old age .", " 8 Thought was secondary to speech, but was the Olympian religion, the religion of Homer and the city-state, separate from and superior to the older religion of family and household.", " While Vesta, the goddess of the hearth, became the protectress of a \u201ccity hearth\u201d and part of the official, political cult after the unification and second foundation of Rome, her Greek colleague, Hestia, is mentioned for the first time by Hesiod, the only Greek poet who, in conscious opposition to Homer, praises the life of the hearth and the household; in the official religion of the polis, she had to cede her place in the assembly of the twelve Olympian gods to Dionysos (see Mommsen,

Alter speech and action were considered to be coeval and coequal, of the same rank and the same kind; and this originally meant not only that most political action, in so far as it remains outside the sphere of violence, is indeed transacted in words, but more fundamentally that finding the right words at the right moment, quite apart from the information or communication they may convey, is action.", " Only sheer violence is mute, and for this reason violence alone can never be great.", " Even when, relatively late in antiquity, the arts of war and speech ( rhetoric ) emerged as the two principal political subjects of education, the development was still inspired by this older pr e-polis experience and tradition and remained subject to it.", " In the experience of the polis, which not without justification has been called the most talkative of all bodies politic, and even more in the political philosophy which sprang from it, action and speech separated and became more and more independent activities.", " The emphasis shifted from action to speech, and to speech as a means of persuasion rather than the specifically human way of answering, talking back and measuring up to whatever happened or was done .", " 9 To be political, to live in a polis, meant that everything was decided through words and persuasion and not through force and violence.", " In Greek

oratio.", " 9.", " It is characteristic for this development that every politician was called a \u201crhetor\u201d and that rhetoric, the art of public speaking, as distinguished from dialectic, the art of philosophic speech, is defined by Aristotle as the art of persuasion (see Rhetoric 1354al2 ff.", ", 1355b26 ff.", ").", " (The distinction itself is derived from Plato, Gorgias 448.", ") It is in this sense that we must understand the Greek opinion of the decline of Thebes, which was ascribed to Theban neglect of rhetoric in favor of military exercise (see Jacob Burckhardt, Griechische Kulturgeschichte, ed.", " Kroener, III, 190).", " The Public and the Private Realm by violence, to command rather than persuade, were prepolitical ways to deal with people characteristic of life outside the polls, of home and family life, where the household head ruled with uncontested, despotic powers, or of life in the barbarian empires of Asia, whose despotism was frequently likened to the organization of the household.", " Aristotle\u2019s definition of man as zoon politikon was not only unrelated and even opposed to the natural association experienced in household life; it can be fully understood only if one adds his second famous definition of man as a zoon logon ekhon (\u201ca living being capable of speech\u201d) .", " The Latin translation of this term into animal rationale rests on no less fundamental a misunderstanding than the term \u201csocial animal.", "\u201d Aristotle meant neither to define man in general nor to indicate man\u2019s highest capacity, which to him was not logos , that is, not speech or reason, but nous , the capacity of contemplation, whose chief characteristic is that its content cannot be rendered in speech .", " 10 In his two most famous definitions, Aristotle only formulated the current opinion of the polls about man and the political way of life, and according to this opinion, everybody outside the polls \u2014 slaves and barbarians\u2014 was aneu logou , deprived, of course, not of the faculty of speech, but of a way of life in which speech and only speech made sense and where the central concern of all citizens was to talk with each other.", " The profound misunderstanding expressed in the Latin translation of \u201cpolitical\u201d as \u201csocial\u201d is perhaps nowhere clearer than in a discussion in wLich Thomas Aquinas compares the nature of household rule with political rule: the head of the household, he finds, has some similarity to the head of the kingdom, but, he adds, his power is not so \u201cperfect\u201d as that of the king .", " 11 Not only in Greece and the polls but throughout the whole of occidental antiquity, it would indeed have been self-evident that even the power of the tyrant was less great, less \u201cperfect\u201d than the power with which the paterfamilias , the domlnus , ruled over his household of slaves and family.", " And this was not because the power of the

political and social realms is as old as the translation of Greek terms into Latin and their adaption to Roman-Christian thought, it has become even more confusing in modern usage and modem understanding of society.", " The distinction between a private and a public sphere of life corresponds to the household and the political realms, which have existed as distinct, separate entities at least since the rise of the ancient city-state; but the emergence of the social realm, which is neither private nor public, strictly speaking, is a relatively new phenomenon whose origin coincided with the emergence of the modern age and which found its political form in the nation-state.", " What concerns us in this context is the extraordinary difficulty with which we, because of this development, understand the decisive division between the public and private realms, between the sphere of the polls and the sphere of household and family, and, finally, between activities related to a common world and those related to the maintenance of life, a division upon which all ancient political thought rested as self-evident and axiomatic.", " In our understanding, the dividing line is entirely blurred, because we see the body of peoples and political communities in the image of a family whose everyday affairs have to be taken care of by a gigantic, nation-wide administration of housekeeping.", " The scientific thought that corresponds to this development is no longer political science but \u201cnational economy\u201d or \u201csocial economy\u201d or Volkswirtschaft, all of which indicate a kind of \u201ccollective house12.", " The terms dominus and paterfamilias therefore were synonymous, like the terms servus and familiaris: Dominum patrem familiae appellaverunt;

of the medieval kingdom and feudalism, in whose framework the family and household unit have an importance unequalled in classical antiquity.", " The difference, however, is marked.", " Within the

not pretend, like an absolute ruler, to be the head of one family.", " The medieval \u201cnation\u201d was a conglomeration of families; its members did not think of themselves as members of one

because they were driven by their wants and needs.", " The driving force was life itself\u2014 the penates, the household gods, were, according to Plutarch, \u201cthe gods who make us live and nourish our body\u201d 19 \u2014 which, for its individual maintenance and its survival as the life of the species needs the company of others.", " That individual maintenance should be the task of the man and species survival the task of the woman was obvious, and both of these natural functions, the labor of man to provide nourishment and the labor of the woman in giving birth, were subject to the same urgency of life.", " Natural community in the household therefore was born of necessity, and necessity ruled over all activities performed in it.", " The realm of the polls , on the contrary, was

that this early earth-bound religion served life and death as two aspects of the same process.", " Life rises out of the earth and returns to it; birth and death are but two different stages of the same biological life over which the subterranean gods hold sway.", " The Public and the Private Realm in the household was the condition for freedom of the polls.", " Under no circumstances could politics be only a means to protect society \u2014 a society of the faithful, as in the Middle Ages, or a society of property-owners, as in Locke, or a society relentlessly engaged in a process of acquisition, as in Hobbes, or a society of producers, as in Marx, or a society of jobholders, as in our own society, or a society of laborers, as in socialist and communist countries.", " In all these cases, it is the freedom (and in some instances so-called freedom) of society which requires and justifies the restraint of political authority.", " Freedom is located in the realm of the social, and force or violence becomes the monopoly of government.", " What all Greek philosophers, no matter how opposed to polls life, took for granted is that freedom is exclusively located in the political realm, that necessity is primarily a prepolitical phenomenon, characteristic of the private household organization, and that force and violence are justified in this sphere because they are the only means to master necessity \u2014 for instance, by ruling over slaves \u2014 and to become free.", " Because all human beings are subject to necessity, they are entitled to violence toward others; violence is the prepolitical act of liberating oneself from the necessity of life for the freedom of world.", " This freedom is the essential condition of what the Greeks called felicity, eudaimonia, which was an objective status depending first of all upon wealth and health.", " To be poor or to be in ill health meant to be subject to physical necessity, and to be a slave meant to be subject, in addition, to manmade violence.", " This twofold and doubled \u201cunhappiness\u201d of slavery is quite independent of the actual subjective well-being of the slave.", " Thus, a poor free man preferred the insecurity of a daily-changing labor market to regular assured work, which, because it restricted his freedom to do as he pleased every day, was already felt to be servitude ( douleia ), and even harsh, painful labor was preferred to the easy life of many household slaves .", " 20 20.", " The discussion between Socrates and Eutherus in Xenophon\u2019s Memorabilia (ii.", " 8) is quite

" It meant neither to rule nor to be ruled .", " 22 Thus within the realm of the household, freedom did not exist, for the household head, its ruler, was considered to be free only in so far as he had the power to leave the household and enter the political realm, where all were equals.", " To be sure, this equality of the political realm has very little in common with our concept of equality: it meant to live among and to have to deal only with one\u2019s peers, and it presupposed the existence of \u201cunequals\u201d who, as a matter of fact, were always the majority of the population in a

Since then, pkilopsychia (\u201clove of life\u201d) and cowardice became identified with slavishness.", " Thus, Plato could believe he had demonstrated the natural slavishness of slaves by the fact that they had not preferred death to enslavement ( Republic 386A).", " A late echo of this might still be found in Seneca\u2019s answer to the complaints of slaves: \u201cIs freedom so close at hand,

proved their slavish nature by not committing suicide, and since courage was the political virtue par excellence, they had thereby shown their \u201cnatural\u201d unworthiness, their unfitness to be citizens.", " The attitude toward slaves changed in the Roman Empire, not only because of the influence of Stoicism but because a much greater portion of the slave population were slaves by birth.", "

overcoming the innate urge of all living creatures for their own survival, it was no longer bound to the biological life process.", " At the root of Greek political consciousness we find an unequaled clarity and articulateness in drawing this distinction.", " No activity that served only the purpose of making a living, of sustaining only the life process, was permitted to enter the political realm, and this at the grave risk of abandoning trade and manufacture to the industriousness of slaves and foreigners, so that Athens indeed became the \u201cpensionopolis\u201d with a \u201cproletariat of consumers\u201d which Max Weber so vividly described .", " 32 The true character of this polls is still quite manifest in Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s political philosophies, even if the borderline between household and polls is occasionally blurred, especially in Plato who, probably following Socrates, began to draw his examples and illustrations for the polls from everyday experiences in private life, but also in Aristotle when he, following Plato, tentatively assumed that at least the historical origin of the polls must be connected with the necessities of life and that only its content or inherent aim ( telos ) transcends life in the \u201cgood life.", "\u201d These aspects of the teachings of the Socratic school, which soon were to become axiomatic to the point of banality, were then the newest and most revolutionary of all and sprang not from actual experience in political life but from the desire to be freed from its burden, a desire which in their own understanding the philosophers could justify only by demonstrating that even this freest of all ways of life was still connected with and subject to necessity.", " But the background of actual political experience, at least in Plato and Aristotle, remained so strong that the distinction between the spheres of household and political life was never doubted.", " Without mastering the necessities of life in the household, neither life nor the \u201cgood life\u201d is possible, but politics is never for the sake of life.", " As far as the members of the polls are concerned, household life exists for the sake of the \u201cgood life\u201d in the polls.", " 32.", " Max Weber, \u201cAgrarverhaltnisse im Altertum,\u201d Gescmmelte Aufsdtze zur Sozialund Wirtschaftsgeschichte

household into the light of the public sphere, has not only blurred the old borderline between private and political, it has also changed almost beyond recognition the meaning of the two terms and their significance for the life of the individual and the citizen.", " Not only would we not agree with the Greeks that a life spent in the privacy of \u201cone\u2019s own\u201d ( idion ), outside the world of the common, is \u201cidiotic\u201d by definition, or with the Romans to whom privacy offered but a temporary refuge from the business of the res publica; we call private today a sphere of intimacy whose beginnings we may be able to trace back to late Roman, though hardly to any period of Greek antiquity, but whose peculiar manifoldness and variety were certainly unknown to any period prior to the modern age.", " This is not merely a matter of shifted emphasis.", " In ancient feeling the privative trait of privacy, indicated in the word itself, was all-important; it meant literally a state of being deprived of something, and even of the highest and most human of man\u2019s capacities.", " A man who lived only a private life, who like the slave was not permitted to enter the public realm, or like the barbarian had chosen not to establish such a realm, was not fully human.", " We no longer think primarily of deprivation when we use the word \u201cprivacy,\u201d and this is partly due to the enormous enrichment of the private sphere through modern individualism.", " However, it seems even more important that modern privacy is at least as sharply opposed to the social realm \u2014 unknown to the ancients who considered its content a private matter\u2014 as it is to the political, properly speaking.", " The decisive historical fact is that modern privacy in its most relevant function, to shelter the intimate, was discovered as the opposite not of the political sphere but of the social, to which it is therefore more closely and authentically related.", " The first articulate explorer and to an extent even theorist of The Public and the Private Realm intimacy was Jean-Jacques Rousseau who, characteristically enough, is the only great author still frequently cited by his first name alone.", " He arrived at his discovery through a rebellion not against the oppression of the state but against society\u2019s unbearable perversion of the human heart, its intrusion upon an innermost region in man which until then had needed no special protection.", " The intimacy of the heart, unlike the private household, has no objective tangible place in the world, nor can the society against which it protests and asserts itself be localized with the same certainty as the public space.", " To Rousseau, both the intimate and the social were, rather, subjective modes of human existence, and in his case, it was as though Jean-Jacques rebelled against a man called Rousseau.", " The modern individual and his endless conflicts, his inability either to be at home in society or to live outside it altogether, his ever-changing moods and the radical subjectivism of his emotional life, was born in this rebellion of the heart.", " The authenticity of Rousseau\u2019s discovery is beyond doubt, no matter how doubtful the authenticity of the individual who was Rousseau.", " The astonishing flowering of poetry and music from the middle of the eighteenth century until almost the last third of the nineteenth, accompanied by the rise of the novel, the only entirely social art form, coinciding with a no less striking decline of all the more public arts, especially architecture, is sufficient testimony to a close relationship between the social and the intimate.", " The rebellious reaction against society during which Rousseau and the Romanticists discovered intimacy was directed first of all against the leveling demands of the social, against what we would call today the conformism inherent in every society.", " It is important to remember that this rebellion took place before the principle of equality, upon which we have blamed conformism since Tocqueville, had had the time to assert itself in either the social or the political realm.", " Whether a nation consists of equals or non-equals is of no great importance in this respect, for society always demands that its members act as though they were members of one enormous family which has only one opinion and one interest.", " Before the modern disintegration of the family, this common interest and single opinion was represented by the household head who ruled in accordance with it and prevented possible disunity among the family members .", " 33 The striking coincidence of the rise of society with the decline of the family indicates clearly that what actually took place was the absorption of the family unit into corresponding social groups.", " The equality of the members of these groups, far from being an equality among peers, resembles nothing so much as the equality of household members before the despotic power of the household head, except that in society, where the natural strength of one common interest and one unanimous opinion is tremendously enforced by sheer number, actual rule exerted by one man, representing the common interest and the right opinion, could eventually be dispensed with.", " The phenomenon of conformism is characteristic of the last stage of this modern development.", " It is true that one-man, monarchical rule, which the ancients stated to be the organizational device of the household, is transformed in society \u2014 as we know it today, when the peak of the social order is no longer formed by the royal household of an absolute ruler \u2014 into a kind of no-man rule.", " But this nobody, the assumed one interest of society as a whole in economics as well as the assumed one opinion of polite society in the salon, does not cease to rule for having lost its personality.", " As we know from the most social form of government, that is, from bureaucracy (the last stage of government in the nation-state just as one-man rule in benevolent despotism and absolutism was its first) , the rule by nobody is not necessarily no-rule; it may indeed, under certain circumstances, even turn out to be one of its crudest and most tyrannical versions.", " It is decisive that society, on all its levels, excludes the possibility of action, which formerly was excluded from the household.", " Instead, society expects from each of its members a certain kind of behavior, imposing innumerable and various rules, all of which tend to \u201cnormalize\u201d its members, to make them behave, to exclude spontaneous action or outstanding achievement.", " With 3 3.", " This is well illustrated by a remark of Seneca, who, discussing the usefulness of highly educated slaves (who know all the classics by heart) to an assumedly rather ignorant master, comments: \u201cWhat the household knows the master knows\u201d ( Ep .", " 27.", " 6, quoted from Barrow, Slavery in the Roman Empire, p.", " 61 ).", " The Public and the Private Realm Rousseau, we find these demands in the salons of high society, whose conventions always equate the individual with his rank within the social framework.", " What matters is this equation with social status, and it is immaterial whether the framework happens to be actual rank in the half-feudal society of the eighteenth century, title in the class society of the nineteenth, or mere function in the mass society of today.", " The rise of mass society, on the contrary, only indicates that the various social groups have suffered the same absorption into one society that the family units had suffered earlier; with the emergence of mass society, the realm of the social has finally, after several centuries of development, reached the point where it embraces and controls all members of a given community equally and with equal strength.", " But society equalizes under all circumstances, and the victory of equality in the modern world is only the political and legal recognition of the fact that society has conquered the public realm, and that distinction and difference have become private matters of the individual.", " This modern equality, based on the conformism inherent in society and possible only because behavior has replaced action

extent of society\u2019s victory in the modern age, its early substitution of behavior for action and its eventual substitution of bureaucracy, the rule of nobody, for personal rulership, it may be well to recall that its initial science of economics, which substitutes patterns of behavior only in this rather limited field of human activity, was finally followed by the all-comprehensive pretension of the social sciences which, as \u201cbehavioral sciences,\u201d aim to reduce man as a whole, in all his activities, to the level of a conditioned and behaving animal.", " If economics is the science of society in its early stages, when it could impose its rules of behavior only on sections of the population and on parts of their activities, the rise of the \u201cbehavioral sciences\u201d indicates clearly the final stage of this development, when mass society has devoured all strata of the nation and \u201csocial behavior\u201d has become the standard for all regions of life.", " Since the rise of society, since the admission of household and housekeeping activities to the public realm, an irresistible tendency to grow, to devour the older realms of the political and private as well as the more recently established sphere of intimacy, has been one of the outstanding characteristics of the new realm.", "This constant growth, whose no less constant acceleration we can observe over at least three centuries, derives its strength from the fact that through society it is the life process itself which in one form or another has been channeled into the public realm.", " The private realm of the household was the sphere where the necessities of life, of individual survival as well as of continuity of the species, were taken care of and guaranteed.", " One of the character37.", " For a brilliant exposition of this usually neglected aspect of Marx\u2019s relevance for modern society, see Siegfried Landshut, \u201cDie Gegenwart im Lichte der Marxschen Lehre,\u201d Hamburger Jahrbuch fur Wirtschaftsund Gesellschaftspolitik , istics of privacy, prior to the discovery of the intimate, was that man existed in this sphere not as a truly human being but only as a specimen of the animal species man-kind.", " This, precisely, was the ultimate reason for the tremendous contempt held for it by antiquity.", " The emergence of society has changed the estimate of this whole sphere but has hardly transformed its nature.", " The monolithic character of every type of society, its conformism which allows for only one interest and one opinion, is ultimately rooted in the one-ness of man-kind.", " It is because this one-ness of man-kind is not fantasy and not even merely a scientific hypothesis, as in the \u201ccommunistic fiction\u201d of classical economics, that mass society, where man as a social animal rules supreme and where apparently the survival of the species could be guaranteed on a world-wide scale, can at the same time threaten humanity with extinction.", " Perhaps the clearest indication that society constitutes the public organization of the life process itself may be found in the fact that in a relatively short time the new social realm transformed all modern communities into societies of laborers and jobholders; in other words, they became at once centered around the one activity necessary to sustain life.", " ( lb have a society of laborers, it is of course not necessary that every member actually be a laborer or worker \u2014 not even the emancipation of the working class and the enormous potential power which majority rule accords to it are decisive here \u2014 but only that all members consider whatever they do primarily as a way to sustain their own lives and those of their families.", ") Society is the form in which the fact of mutual dependence for the sake of life and nothing else assumes public significance and where the activities connected with sheer survival are permitted to appear in public.", " Whether an activity is performed in private or in public is by no means a matter of indifference.", " Obviously, the character of the public realm must change in accordance with the activities admitted into it, but to a large extent the activity itself changes its own nature too.", " The laboring activity, though under all circumstances connected with the life process in its most elementary, biological sense, remained stationary for thousands of years, imprisoned in the eternal recurrence of the life process to which it was tied.", " The The Public and the Private Realm admission of labor to public stature, far from eliminating its character as a process \u2014 which one might have expected, remembering that bodies politic have always been designed for permanence and their laws always understood as limitations imposed upon movement \u2014 has, on the contrary, liberated this process from its circular, monotonous recurrence and transformed it into a swiftly progressing development whose results have in a few centuries totally changed the whole inhabited world.", " The moment laboring was liberated from the restrictions imposed by its banishment into the private realmand this emancipation of labor was not a consequence of the emancipation of the working class, but preceded it \u2014 it was as though the growth element inherent in all organic life had completely overcome and overgrown the processes of decay by which organic life is checked and balanced in nature\u2019s household.", " The social realm, where the life process has established its own public domain, has let loose an unnatural growth, so to speak, of the natural; and it is against this growth, not merely against society but against a constantly growing social realm, that the private and intimate, on the one hand, and the political (in the narrower sense of the word), on the other, have proved incapable of defending themselves.", " What we described as the unnatural growth of the natural is usually considered to be the constantly accelerated increase in the productivity of labor.", " The greatest single factor in this constant increase since its inception has been the organization of laboring, visible in the so-called division of labor, which preceded the industrial revolution; even the mechanization of labor processes, the second greatest factor in labor\u2019s productivity, is based upon it.", " Inasmuch as the organizational principle itself clearly derives from the public rather than the private realm, division of labor is precisely what happens to the laboring activity under conditions of the public realm and what could never have happened in the privacy of the household .", " 38 In no other sphere of life do we appear to have 38.", " Here and later I apply the term \u201cdivision of labor\u201d only to modern labor conditions where one activity is divided and atomized into innumerable minute manipulations, and not to the \u201cdivision of labor\u201d given in professional specialization.", " The latter can be so classified only under the assumption that society must be conceived as one single subject, the fulfilment of whose needs are then subattained such excellence as in the revolutionary transformation of laboring, and this to the point where the verbal significance of the word itself (which always had been connected with hardly bearable \u201ctoil and trouble,\u201d with effort and pain and, consequently, with a deformation of the human body, so that only extreme misery and poverty could be its source), has begun to lose its meaning for us .", " 39 While dire necessity made labor indispensable to sustain life, excellence would have been the last thing to expect from it.", " Excellence itself, arete as the Greeks, virtus as the Romans divided by \u201can invisible hand\u201d among its members.", " The same holds true, mutatis mutandis, for the odd notion of a division of labor between the sexes, which is even considered by some writers to be the most original one.", " It presumes as its single subject man-kind, the human species, which has divided its labors among men and women.", " Where the same argument is used in antiquity (see, for instance, Xenophon Oeconomicus vii.", " 22), emphasis and meaning are quite different.", " The main division is between a life spent indoors, in the household, and a life spent outside, in the world.", " Only the latter is a life fully worthy of man, and the notion of equality between man and woman, which is a necessary assumption for the idea of division of labor, is of course entirely absent (cf.", " n.", " 81).", " Antiquity seems to have known only professional specialization, which assumedly was predetermined by natural qualities and gifts.", " Thus

called it, has always been assigned to the public realm where one could excel, could distinguish oneself from all others.", " Every activity performed in public can attain an excellence never matched in privacy; for excellence, by definition, the presence of others is always required, and this presence needs the formality of the public, constituted by one\u2019s peers, it cannot be the casual, familiar presence of one\u2019s equals or inferiors .", " 40 Not even the social realm \u2014 though it made excellence anonymous, emphasized the progress of mankind rather than the achievements of men, and changed the content of the public realm beyond recognition\u2014 has been able altogether to annihilate the connection between public performance and excellence.", " While we have become excellent in the laboring we perform in public, our capacity for action and speech has lost much of its former quality since the rise of the social realm banished these into the sphere of the intimate and the private.", " This curious discrepancy has not escaped public notice, where it is usually blamed upon an assumed time lag between our technical capacities and our general humanistic development or between the physical sciences, which change and control nature, and the social sciences, which do not yet know how to change and control society.", " Quite apart from other fallacies of the argument which have been pointed out so frequently that we need not repeat them, this criticism concerns only a possible change in the psychology of human beings \u2014 their so-called behavior patterns \u2014 not a change of the world they move in.", " And this psychological interpretation, for which the absence or presence of a public realm is as irrelevant as any tangible, worldly reality, seems rather doubtful in view of the fact that no activity can become excellent if the world does not provide a proper space for its exercise.", " Neither education nor ingenuity nor talent can replace the constituent elements of the public realm, which make it the proper place for human excellence.", " 40.", " Homer\u2019s much quoted thought that Zeus takes away half of a man\u2019s excellence (arete) when the day of slavery catches him ( Odyssey xvii.", " 320 ff.", ") is put into the mouth of Eumaios, a slave himself, and meant as an objective statement, not a criticism or a moral judgment.", " The slave lost excellence because he lost admission to the public realm, where excellence can show.", " 7 THE PUBLIC REALM: THE COMMON The term \u201cpublic\u201d signifies two

us, appearance\u2014 something that is being seen and heard by others as well as by ourselves \u2014 constitutes reality.", " Compared with the reality which comes from being seen and heard, even the greatest forces of intimate life \u2014 the passions of the heart, the thoughts of the mind, the delights of the senses\u2014 lead an uncertain, shadowy kind of existence unless and until they are transformed, deprivatized and deindividualized, as it were, into a shape to fit them for public appearance .", " 41 The most current of such transformations occurs in storytelling and generally in artistic transposition of individual experiences.", " But we do not need the form of the artist to witness this transfiguration.", " Each time we talk about things that can be experienced only in privacy or intimacy, we bring them out into a sphere where they will assume a kind of reality which, their intensity notwithstanding, they never could have had before.", " The presence of others who see what we see and hear what we hear assures us of the reality of the world and ourselves, and while the intimacy of a fully developed private life, such as had never been known before the rise of the modern age and the concomitant decline of the public realm, will always greatly intensify and enrich the whole scale of subjective emotions and private feelings, this intensification will always come to pass at the expense of the assurance of the reality of the world and men.", " Indeed, the most intense feeling we know of, intense to the point of blotting out all other experiences, namely, the experience of great bodily pain, is at the same time the most private and least 41.", " This is also the reason why it is impossible \u201cto write a character sketch of any slave who lived.", "

to the outer world of life .", " 42 Pain, in other words, truly a borderline experience between life as \u201cbeing among men\u201d ( inter homines esse ) and death, is so subjective and removed from the world of things and men that it cannot assume an appearance at all .", " 43 Since our feeling for reality depends utterly upon appearance and therefore upon the existence of a public realm into which things can appear out of the darkness of sheltered existence, even the twilight which illuminates our private and intimate lives is ultimately derived from the much harsher light of the public realm.", " Yet there are a great many things which cannot withstand the implacable, bright light of the constant presence of others on the public scene; there, only what is considered to be relevant, worthy of being seen or heard, can be tolerated, so that the irrelevant becomes automatically a private matter.", " This, to be sure, does not mean that private concerns are generally irrelevant; on the contrary, we shall see that there are very relevant matters which can survive only in the realm of the private.", " For instance, love, in distinction from friendship, is killed, or rather

early twentieth-century poetry in almost all European tongues, has found its classical presentation in the petit bonheur of the French people.", " Since the decay of their once great and glorious public realm, the French have become masters in the art of being happy among \u201csmall things,\u201d within the space of their own four walls, between chest and bed, table and chair, dog and cat and flowerpot, extending to these things a care and tenderness which, in a world where rapid industrialization constantly kills off the things of yesterday to produce today\u2019s objects, may even appear to be the world\u2019s last, purely humane corner.", " This enlargement of the private, the enchantment, as it were, of a whole people, does not make it public, does not constitute a public realm, but, on the contrary, means only that the public realm has almost completely receded, so that greatness has given way to charm everywhere; for while the public realm may be great, it cannot be charming precisely because it is unable to harbor the irrelevant.", " Second, the term \u201cpublic\u201d signifies the world itself, in so far as it is common to all of us and distinguished from our privately owned place in it.", " This world, however, is not identical with the earth or with nature, as the limited space for the movement of men and the general condition of organic life.", " It is related, rather, to the human artifact, the fabrication of human hands, as well as to affairs which go on among those who inhabit the man-made world together.", " To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it; the world, like every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time.", " The public realm, as the common world, gathers us together and yet prevents our falling over each other, so to speak.", " What makes mass society so difficult to bear is not the number of people The Public and the Private Realm involved, or at least not primarily, but the fact that the world between them has lost its power to gather them together, to relate and to separate them.", " The weirdness of this situation resembles a spiritualistic seance where a number of people gathered around a table might suddenly, through some magic trick, see the table vanish from their midst, so that two persons sitting opposite each other were no longer separated but also would be entirely unrelated to each other by anything tangible.", " Historically, we know of only one principle that was ever devised to keep a community of people together who had lost their interest in the common world and felt themselves no longer related and separated by it.", " To find a bond between people strong enough to replace the world was the main political task of early Christian philosophy, and it was Augustine who proposed to found not only the Christian \u201cbrotherhood\u201d but all human relationships on charity.", " But this charity, though its worldlessness clearly corresponds to the general human experience of love, is at the same time clearly distinguished from it in being something which, like the world, is between men: \u201cEven robbers have between them [inter rr] what they call charity .", "\u201d 44 This surprising illustration of the Christian political principle is in fact very well chosen, because the bond of charity between people, while it is incapable of founding a public realm of its own, is quite adequate to the main Christian principle of worldlessness and is admirably fit to carry a group of essentially worldless people through the world, a group of saints or a group of criminals, provided only it is understood that the world itself is doomed and that every activity in it is undertaken with the proviso quamdiu mundus durat (\u201cas long as the world lasts \u201d).", " 45 The unpolitical, non-public character of the Christian community was early defined in the demand that it should form a corpus , a \u201cbody,\u201d whose members were to be related to each other like brothers of the same family .", " 46 The structure of communal life

public realm had never come into being between the members of a family, and it was therefore not likely to develop from Christian community life if this life was ruled by the principle of charity and nothing else.", " Even then, as we know from the history and the rules of the monastic orders \u2014 the only communities in which the principle of charity as a political device was ever tried \u2014 the danger that the activities undertaken under \u201cthe necessity of present life\u201d ( necessitas vitae praesentis ) 47 would lead by themselves, because they were performed in the presence of

non-existence nobody can ever testify except the one who happens to suffer them.", " And since the need for food has its demonstrable basis of reality in the life process itself, it is also obvious

poetry and philosophy in the modern world, but that such admiration does not constitute a space in which things are saved from destruction by time.", " The futility of public admiration, which daily is consumed in ever greater quantities, on the contrary, is such that monetary reward, one of the most futile things there is, can become more \u201cobjective\u201d and more real.", " As distinguished from this \u201cobjectivity,\u201d whose only basis is money as a common denominator for the fulfilment of all needs, the reality of the public realm relies on the simultaneous presence of innumerable perspectives and aspects in which the common world presents itself and for which no common measurement or denominator can ever be devised.", " For though the common world is the common meeting ground of all, those who are present have different locations in it, and the location of one can no more coincide with the location of another than the location of two objects.", " Being seen and being heard by others derive their significance from the fact that everybody sees and hears from a different position.", " This is the meaning of public life, compared to which even the richest and most satisfying family life can offer only the prolongation or multiplication of one\u2019s own position with its attending aspects and perspectives.", " The subjectivity of privacy can be prolonged and multiplied in a family, it can even become so strong that its weight is felt in the public realm; but this family \u201cworld\u201d can never replace the reality rising out of the sum total of aspects presented by one object to a multitude of spectators.", " Only where things can be seen by many in a variety of aspects without changing their identity, so that those who are gathered around them know they see sameness in utter diversity, can worldly reality truly and reliably appear.", " Under the conditions of a common world, reality is not guaranteed primarily by the \u201ccommon nature\u201d of all men who constitute it, but rather by the fact that, differences of position and the resulting variety of perspectives notwithstanding, everybody is always concerned with the same object.", " If the sameness of the object can no longer be discerned, no common nature of men, least of all the unnatural conformism of a mass society, can prevent the destruction of the common world, which is usually preceded by the destruction of the many aspects in which it presents itself to human plurality.", " This can happen under conditions of radical isolation, where nobody can any longer agree with anybody else, as is usually the case in tyrannies.", " But it may also happen under conditions of mass society or mass hysteria, where we see all people suddenly behave as though they were members of one family, each multiplying and prolonging the perspective of his neighbor.", " In both instances, men have become entirely private, that is, they have been deprived of seeing and hearing others, of being seen and being heard by them.", " They are all imprisoned in the subjectivity of their own singular experience, which does not cease to be singular if the same experience is multiplied innumerable times.", " The end of the common world has come when it is seen only under one aspect and is permitted to present itself in only one perspective.", " 8 THE PRIVATE REALM: PROPERTY It is with respect to this multiple significance of the public realm that the term \u201cprivate,\u201d in its original privative sense, has meaning.", " To live an entirely private life means above all to be deprived of things essential to a truly human life: to be deprived of the reality that comes from being seen and heard by others, to be deprived of an \u201cobjective\u201d relationship with them that comes from being related to and separated from them through the intermediary of a common world of things, to be deprived of the possibility of achieving something more permanent than life itself.", " The privation of privacy lies in the absence of others; as far as they are concerned, private man does not appear, and therefore it is as though he did not exist.", " Whatever he does remains without significance and consequence to others, and what matters to him is without interest to other people.", " Under modern circumstances, this deprivation of \u201cobjective\u201d The Public and the Private Realm relationships to others and of a reality guaranteed through them has become the mass phenomenon of loneliness, where it has assumed its most extreme and most antihuman form .", " 62 The reason for this extremity is that mass society not only destroys the public realm but the private as well, deprives men not only of their place in the world but of their private home, where they once felt sheltered against the world and where, at any rate, even those excluded from the world could find a substitute in the warmth of the hearth and the limited reality of family life.", " The full development of the life of hearth and family into an inner and private space we owe to the extraordinary political sense of the Roman people who, unlike the Greeks, never sacrificed the private to the public, but on the contrary understood that these two realms could exist only in the form of coexistence.", " And although the conditions of slaves probably were hardly better in Rome than in Athens, it is quite characteristic that a Roman writer should have believed that to slaves the household of the master was what the res publica was to citizens .", " 53 Yet no matter how bearable private life in the family might have been, it could obviously never be more than a substitute, even though the private realm in Rome as in Athens offered plenty of room for activities which we today class higher than political activity, such as the accumulation of wealth in Greece or the devotion to art and science in Rome.", " This \u201cliberal\u201d attitude, which could under certain circumstances result in very prosperous and highly educated slaves, meant only that to be prosperous had no reality in the Greek polls and to be a philosopher was without much consequence in the Roman republic .", " 64 52.", " For modern loneliness as a mass phenomenon see David Riesman, The Lonely Crowd (1950).", " 53.", " So Plinius Junior, quoted in W.", " I.", " Westermann, \u201cSklaverei,\u201d in PaulyWissowa, Suppl.", " VI, p, 1045.", " 54.", " There is plenty of evidence for this different estimation of wealth and culture in Rome and Greece.", " But it is interesting to note how consistently this estimate coincided with the position of slaves.", " Roman slaves played a much greater role in Roman culture than in Greece, where, on the other hand, their role in economic life was much more important (see Westermann, in Pauly-Wissowa, p.", " 984).", " It is a matter of course that the privative trait of privacy, the consciousness of being deprived of something essential in a life spent exclusively in the restricted sphere of the household, should have been weakened almost to the point of extinction by the rise of Christianity.", " Christian morality, as distinguished from its fundamental religious precepts, has always insisted that everybody should mind his own business and that political responsibility constituted first of all a burden, undertaken exclusively for the sake of the well-being and salvation of those it freed from worry about public affairs .", " 66 It is surprising that this attitude should have survived into the secular modern age to such an extent that Karl Marx, who in this as in other respects only summed up, conceptualized, and transformed into a program the underlying assumptions of two hundred years of modernity, could eventually predict and hope for the \u201cwithering away\u201d of the whole public realm.", " The difference between the Christian and socialist viewpoints in this respect, the one viewing government as a necessary evil because of man\u2019s sinfulness and the other hoping to abolish it eventually, is not a difference in estimate of the public sphere itself, but of human nature.", " What is impossible to perceive from either point of view is that Marx\u2019s \u201cwithering away of the state\u201d had been preceded by a withering away of the public realm, or rather by its transformation into a very restricted sphere of government; in Marx\u2019s day, this government had already begun to wither further, that is, to be transformed into a nation-wide \u201chousekeeping,\u201d until in our own day it has begun to disappear altogether into the even more restricted, impersonal sphere of administration.", " It seems to be in the nature of the relationship between the public and private realms that the final stage of the disappearance 55.", " Augustine ( De civitate Dei xix.", " 19) sees in the duty of caritas toward the utilitas proximi (\u201cthe interest of one\u2019s neighbor\u201d) the limitation of otium and contemplation.", " But \u201cin active life, it is not the honors or power of this life we should covet, .", " but the welfare of those who are under us [ salutem subditorurri\\y Obviously, this kind of responsibility resembles the responsibility of the household head for his family more than political responsibility, properly speaking.", " The Christian precept to mind one\u2019s own business is derived from I Thess.", " 4:11: \u201cthat ye study to be quiet and to do your own business\u201d ( prattein ta idia, whereby ta idia is understood as opposed to ta koina [\u201cpublic common affairs\u201d]).", " The Public and the Private Realm of the public realm should be accompanied by the threatened liquidation of the private realm as well.", " Nor is it an accident that the whole discussion has eventually turned into an argument about the desirability or undesirability of privately owned property.", " For the word \u201cprivate\u201d in connection with property, even in terms of ancient political thought, immediately loses its privative character and much of its opposition to the public realm in general; property apparently possesses certain qualifications which, though lying in the private realm, were always thought to be of utmost importance to the political body.", " The profound connection between private and public, manifest on its most elementary level in the question of private property, is likely to be misunderstood today because of the modern equation of property and wealth on one side and propertylessness and poverty on the other.", " This misunderstanding is all the more annoying as both, property as well as wealth, are historically of greater relevance to the public realm than any other private matter or concern and have played, at least formally, more or less the same role as the chief condition for admission to the public realm and full-fledged citizenship.", " It is therefore easy to forget that wealth and property, far from being the same, are of an entirely different nature.", " The present emergence everywhere of actually or potentially very wealthy societies which at the same time are essentially propertyless, because the wealth of any single individual consists of his share in the annual income of society as a whole, clearly shows how little these two things are connected.", " Prior to the modern age, which began with the expropriation of the poor and then proceeded to emancipate the new propertyless classes, all civilizations have rested upon the sacredness of private property.", " Wealth, on the contrary, whether privately owned or publicly distributed, had never been sacred before.", " Originally, property meant no more or less than to have one\u2019s location in a particular part of the world and therefore to belong to the body politic, that is, to be the head of one of the families which together constituted the public realm.", " This piece of privately owned world was so completely identical with the family who owned it 66 that 56.", " Coulanges (op.", " cit .", ") holds: \u201cThe true signification of familia is property; it designates the field, the house, money, and slaves\u201d (p.", " 107).", " Yet, this \u201cpropthe expulsion of a citizen could mean not merely the confiscation of his estate

kind of no man\u2019s land 63 between the private and the public, sheltering and protecting both realms while, at the same time, separating them from each other.", " The law of the polls, to be sure, transcended this ancient understanding from which, however, it retained its original spatial significance.", " The law of the city-state was neither the content of political action (the idea that political activity is primarily legislating, though Roman in origin, is essentially modern and found its greatest expession in Kant\u2019s political philosophy) nor was it a catalogue of prohibitions, resting, as all modern laws still do, upon the Thou Shalt Nots of the Decalogue.", " It was quite literally a 61.", " It seems as though the Eleusinian Mysteries provided for a common and quasi-public

it is much more than that.", " Privacy was like the other, the dark and hidden side of the public realm, and while to be political meant to attain the highest possibility of human existence, to have

concept of government, where the only thing people have in common is their private interests, need no longer bother us as it still bothered Marx, since we know that the contradiction between private and public, typical of the initial stages of the modern age, has been a temporary phenomenon which introduced the utter extinction of the very difference between the private and public realms, the submersion of both in the sphere of the social.", " By the same token, we are in a far better position to realize the consequences for human existence when both the public and private spheres of life are gone, the public because it has become a function of the private and the private because it has become the only common concern left.", " Seen from this viewpoint, the modern discovery of intimacy seems a flight from the whole outer world into the inner subjectivity of the individual, which formerly had been sheltered and protected by the private realm.", " The dissolution of this realm into the social may most conveniently be watched in the progressing transformation of immobile into mobile property until eventually the distinction between property and wealth, between the fungibiles and the consumpti biles of Roman law, loses all significance because every tangible, \u201cfungible\u201d thing has become an object of \u201cconsumption\u201d; it lost its private use value which was determined by its location and acquired an exclusively social value determined through its ever-changing exchangeability whose fluctuation could itself be fixed only temporarily by relating it to the common denominator of money .", " 76 Closely connected with this social evapora75.", " Medieval economic theory did not yet conceive of money as a common denominator and yardstick but counted it among

called \u201claborpower.", "\u201d Thus modern property lost its worldly character and was located in the person himself, that is, in what an individual could lose only along with his life.", " Historically, Locke\u2019s assumption that the labor of one\u2019s body is the origin of property is more than doubtful; but in view of the fact that we already live under conditions where our only

existence from the elimination of the private realm, for which the intimate is not a very reliable substitute, it may be best to consider those nonprivative traits of privacy which are older than, and

discussions of freedom, where freedom is never understood as an objective state of human existence but either presents an unsolvable problem of subjectivity, of an entirely undetermined or determined will, or develops out of necessity, all point to the fact that the objective, tangible difference between being free and being forced by necessity is no longer perceived.", ") The second outstanding non-privative characteristic of privacy is that the four walls of one\u2019s private property offer the only reliable hiding place from the common public world, not only from everything that goes on in it but also from its very publicity, from being seen and being heard.", " A life spent entirely in public, in the presence of others, becomes, as we would say, shallow.", " While it retains its visibility, it loses the quality of rising into sight from some darker ground which must remain hidden if it is not to lose its depth in a very real, non-subjective sense.", " The only efficient way to guarantee the darkness of what needs to be hidden against the light of publicity is private property, a privately owned place to hide in .", " 78 While it is only natural that the non-privative traits of privacy should appear most clearly when men are threatened with deprivation of it, the practical treatment of private property by premodern political bodies indicates clearly that men have always been conscious of their existence and importance.", " This, however, did not make them protect the activities in the private realm directly, but rather the boundaries separating the privately

crucial issue, has been its stress upon the private activities of property -owners and their need of government protection for the sake of accumulation of wealth at the expense of the tangible

The invasion of privacy by society, the \u201csocialization of man\u201d (Marx), is most efficiently carried through by means of expropriation, but this is not the only way.", " Here, as in other

property in particular.", " The distinction between the private and public realms, seen from the viewpoint of privacy rather than of the body politic, equals the distinction between things that should be shown and things that should be hidden.", " Only the modern age, in its rebellion against society, has discovered how rich and manifold the realm of the hidden can be under the conditions of intimacy; but it is striking that from the beginning of history to our own time it has always been the bodily part of human existence that needed to be hidden in privacy, all things connected with the necessity of the life process itself, which prior to the modern age comprehended all activities serving the subsistence of the individual and the survival of the species.", " Hidden away were the

ACTIVITIES Although the distinction between private and public coincides with the opposition of necessity and freedom, of futility and permanence, and, finally, of shame and honor, it is by no means true that only the necessary, the futile, and the shameful have their proper place in the private realm.", " The most elementary meaning of the two realms indicates that there are things that need to be hidden and others that need to be displayed publicly if they are to exist at all.", " If we look at these things, regardless of where we find them in any given civilization, we shall see that each human activity points to its proper location in the world.", " This is true for the chief activities of the vita activa, labor, work, and action; but there is one, admittedly extreme, example of this

no man can be wise, out of which love for wisdom, or philo-sophy, was born; the whole life story of Jesus seems to testify how love for goodness arises out of the insight that no man can be good.", " Love of wisdom and love of goodness, if they resolve themselves into the activities of philosophizing and doing good works, have in common that they come to an immediate end, cancel themselves, so to speak, whenever it is assumed that man can be wise or be good.", " Attempts to bring into being that which can never survive the fleeting moment of the deed itself have never been lacking and have

testimony and lacks first of all the company of himself.", " He is not solitary, but lonely; when living with others he must hide from them and cannot even trust himself to witness what he is doing.", " The philosopher can always rely upon his thoughts to keep him company, whereas good deeds can never keep anybody company; they must be forgotten the moment they are done, because even memory will destroy their quality of being \u201cgood.", "\u201d Moreover, thinking, because it can be remembered, can crystallize into thought, and thoughts, like all things that owe their existence to remembrance, can be transformed into tangible objects which, like the written page or the printed book, become part of the human artifice.", " Good works, because they must be forgotten instantly, can never become part of the world; they come and go, leaving no trace.", " They truly are not of this world.", " It is this worldlessness inherent in good works that makes the lover of goodness an essentially religious figure and that makes goodness, like wisdom in antiquity, an essentially non-human, superhuman quality.", " And yet love of goodness, unlike love of wisdom, is not restricted to the experience of the few, just as loneliness, unlike solitude, is within the range of every man\u2019s experience.", " In a sense, therefore, goodness and loneliness are of much greater relevance to politics than wisdom and solitude; yet only solitude can become an authentic way of life in the figure of the philosopher, whereas the much more general experience of loneliness is so contradictory to the human condition of plurality that it is simply unbearable for any length of time and needs the company of God, the only imaginable witness of good works, if it is not to annihilate human existence altogether.", " The otherworldiness of religious experience, in so far as it is truly the experience of love in the sense 85.", " One finds this idiom passim in Plato (see esp.", " Gorgias 482).", " The Public and the Private Realm, of an activity, and not the much more frequent one of beholding passively a revealed truth, manifests itself within the world itself; this, like all other activities, does not leave the world, but must be performed within it.", " But this manifestation, though it appears in the space where other activities are performed and depends upon it, is of an actively negative nature; fleeing the world and hiding from its inhabitants, it negates the space the world offers to men, and most of all that public part of it where everything and everybody are seen and heard by others.", " Goodness, therefore, as a consistent way of life, is not only impossible within the confines of the public realm, it is even destructive of it.", " Nobody perhaps has been more sharply aware of this ruinous quality of doing good than Machiavelli, who, in a famous passage, dared to teach men \u201chow not to be good .", "\u201d 86 Needless to add, he did not say and did not mean that men must be taught how to be bad; the criminal act, though for other reasons, must also flee being seen and heard by others.", " Machiavelli\u2019s criterion for political action was glory, the same as in classical antiquity, and badness can no more shine in glory than goodness.", " Therefore all methods by which \u201cone may indeed gain power, but not glory\u201d are bad .", " 87 Badness that comes out of hiding is impudent and directly destroys the common world; goodness that comes out of hiding and assumes a public role is no longer good, but corrupt in its own terms and will carry its own corruption wherever it goes.", " Thus, for Machiavelli, the reason for the Church\u2019s becoming a corrupting influence in Italian politics was her participation in secular affairs as such and not the individual corruptness of bishops and prelates.", " To him, the alternative posed by the problem of religious rule over the secular realm was inescapably this : either the public realm corrupted the religious body and thereby became itself corrupt, or the religious body remained uncorrupt and destroyed the public realm altogether.", " A reformed Church therefore was even more dangerous in Machiavelli\u2019s eyes, and he looked with great respect but greater apprehension upon the religious revival of his time, the \u201cnew orders\u201d which, by \u201csaving religion from

shown in public and which be hidden in privacy, may have their correspondence in the nature of these activities themselves.", " By raising this question, I do not intend to attempt an exhaustive analysis of the activities of the vita activa, whose articulations have been curiously neglected by a tradition which considered it chiefly from the standpoint of the vita contemplativa, but to try to determine with some measure of assurance their political significance.", " 88.", " Discourses, Book HI, ch.", " 1.", " CHAPTER III Labor In the following chapter, Karl Marx will be criticized.", " This is unfortunate at a time when so many writers who once made their living by explicit or tacit borrowing from the great wealth of Marxian ideas and insights have decided to become professional

important one, did ancient and modern usage of the two words as synonyms fail altogether, namely in the formation of a corresponding noun.", " Elere again we find complete unanimity; the word

that we are surrounded by things more permanent than the activity by which they were produced, and potentially even more permanent than the lives of their authors.", " Human life, in so far as it is

altogether different meaning if it is related to the world and meant to designate the time interval between birth and death.", " Limited by a beginning and an end, that is, by the two supreme events of appearance and disappearance within the world, it follows a strictly linear movement whose very motion nevertheless is driven by the motor of biological life which man shares with other living things and which forever retains the cyclical movement of nature.", " The chief characteristic of this specifically human life, whose appearance and disappearance constitute worldly events, is that it is itself always full of events which ultimately can be told as a story, establish a biography; it is of this life, bios as distinguished from mere zoe, that Aristotle said that it \u201csomehow is a kind of praxis .", "\u201d 32 For action and speech, which, as we saw before, belonged close together in the Greek understanding of politics, are indeed the two activities whose end result will always

begin to grow and to decay.", " While nature manifests itself in human existence through the circular movement of our bodily functions, she makes her presence felt in the man-made world through the constant threat of overgrowing or decaying it.", " The common characteristic of both, the biological process in man and the process of growth and decay in the world, is that they are part of the cyclical movement of nature and therefore endlessly repetitive; all human activities which arise out of the necessity to cope with them are bound to the recurring cycles of nature and have in themselves no beginning and no end, properly speaking; unlike working , whose end has come when the object is finished, ready to be added to the common world of things, laboring always moves in the same circle, which is prescribed by the biological process of the living organism and the end of its \u201ctoil and trouble\u201d comes only with the death of this organism .", " 33 When Marx defined

\u2014 \u201cBeim letzten Bissen fiingt schon die Verdauung an.", "\u201d However, in the huge post-Marxian literature on the labor problem, the only author who emphasizes and theorizes about this

operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells.", " But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality.", " At the end of every labourprocess, we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement\u201d ( Capital [Modern Library ed.", "], p.", " 198).", " Obviously, Marx no longer speaks of labor, but of work\u2014 with which he is not concerned; and the best proof of this is that the apparently all-important element of \u201cimagination\u201d plays no role whatsoever in his labor theory.", " In the third volume of Das Kapital he repeats that surplus labor beyond immediate needs serves the \u201cprogressive extension of the reproduction process\u201d (pp.", " 872, 278).", " Despite occasional hesithe life process itself, the \u201cnecessity of subsisting,\u201d as Locke put it, laboring and consuming follow each other so closely that they almost constitute one and the same movement, which is hardly ended when it must be started all over again.", " The \u201cnecessity of subsisting\u201d rules over both labor and consumption, and labor, when it incorporates, \u201cgathers,\u201d and bodily \u201cmixes with\u201d the things provided by nature , 37 does actively what the body does even more intimately when it consumes its nourishment.", " Both are devouring processes that seize and destroy matter, and the \u201cwork\u201d done by labor upon its material is only the preparation for its eventual destruction.", " This destructive, devouring aspect of the laboring activity, to be sure, is visible only from the standpoint of the world and in distinction from work, which does not prepare matter for incorporation but changes it into material in order to work upon it and use the finished product.", " From the viewpoint of nature, it is work rather than labor that is destructive, since the work process takes matter out of nature\u2019s hands without giving it back to her in the swift course of the natural metabolism of the living body.", " Equally bound up with the recurring cycles of natural movements, but not quite so urgently imposed upon man by \u201cthe condition of human life\u201d itself , 38 is the second task of laboring \u2014 its constant, unending fight against the processes of growth and decay through which nature forever invades the human artifice, threatening the durability of the world and its fitness for human use.", " The protection and preservation of the world against natural processes are among the toils which need the monotonous performance of daily repeated chores.", " This laboring fight, as distinguished from the essentially peaceful fulfilment in which labor obeys the orders of immediate bodily needs, although it may be even less \u201cproductive\u201d than man\u2019s direct metabolism with nature, has a much closer connection with the world, which it defends against tations, Marx remained convinced that \u201cMilton produced Paradise Lost for the same reason a silk worm produces silk\u201d ( Theories

\u201clabors.", "\u201d A similar connotation of heroic deeds requiring great strength and courage and performed in a fighting spirit is manifest in the medieval use of the word: labor, travail , arebeit.", " However, the daily fight in which the human body is engaged to keep the world clean and prevent its decay bears little resemblance to heroic deeds; the endurance it needs to repair every day anew the waste of yesterday is not courage, and what makes the effort painful is not danger but its relentless repetition.", " The Herculean \u201clabors\u201d share with all great deeds that they are unique; but unfortunately it is only the mythological Augean stable that will remain clean once the effort is made and the task achieved.", " 14 LABOR AND FERTILITY The sudden, spectacular rise of labor from the lowest, most despised position to the highest rank, as the most esteemed of all human activities, began when Locke discovered that labor is the source of all property.", " It followed its course when Adam Smith asserted that labor was the source of all wealth and found its climax in Marx\u2019s \u201csystem of labor ,\u201d 39 where labor became the source of all productivity and the expression of the very humanity of man.", " Of the three, however, only Marx was interested in labor as such; Locke was concerned with the institution of private property as the root of society and Smith wished to explain and to secure the unhampered progress of a limitless accumulation of wealth.", " But all three, though Marx with greatest force and consistency, held that labor was considered to be the supreme worldbuilding capacity of man, and since labor actually is the most natural and least worldly of man\u2019s activities, each of them, and again none more than Marx, found himself in the grip of certain genuine contradictions.", " It seems to lie in the very nature of this matter that 39.", " The expression is Karl Dunkmann\u2019s ( Soziologie der Arbeit [1933], p.", " 71), who rightly remarks that the title of Marx\u2019s great work is a misnomer and should better have been called System der Arbeit.", " the most obvious solution of these contradictions, or rather the most obvious reason why these great authors should have remained unaware of them is their equation of work with labor, so that labor is endowed by them with certain faculties which only work possesses.", " This equation always leads into patent absurdities, though they usually are not so neatly manifest as in the following sentence of Veblen: \u201cThe lasting evidence of productive labor is its material product \u2014 commonly some article of consumption ,\u201d 40 where the \u201clasting evidence\u201d with which he begins, because he needs it for the alleged productivity of labor, is immediately destroyed by the \u201cconsumption\u201d of the product with which he ends, forced, as it were, by the factual evidence of the phenomenon itself.", " Thus Locke, in order to save labor from its manifest disgrace of producing only \u201cthings of short duration,\u201d had to introduce money \u2014a \u201clasting thing which men may keep without spoiling\u201d \u2014 a kind of deus ex machina without which the laboring body, in its obedience to the life process, could never have become the origin of anything so permanent and lasting as property, because there are no \u201cdurable things\u201d to be kept to survive the activity of the laboring process.", " And even Marx, who actually defined man as an animal laborans, had to admit that productivity of labor, properly speaking, begins only with reification (Vergegemtdndlichung) , with \u201cthe erection of an objective world of things\u201d ( Erzeugung einer gegenstand lichen Welt): n But the effort of labor never frees the labor40.", " The curious formulation occurs in Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (1917), p.", " 44.", " 41.", " The term vergegenstdndlichen occurs not very frequently in Marx, but always in a crucial context.", " Cf.", " Jugendschriften, p.", " 88: \u201cDas praktische Erzeugen einer gegenstandlichen Welt, die Bearbeitung der unorganischen Natur ist die Bewahrung des Menschen als eines bewussten Gattungswesens.", " .", " .", " .", " [Das Tier] produziert unter der Herrschaft des unmittelbaren Bediirfnisses, wahrend der Mensch selbst frei vom physischen Bedurfnis produziert und erst wahrhaft produziert in der Freiheit von demselben.", "\u201d Here, as in the passage from Capital quoted in note 36, Marx obviously introduces an altogether different concept of labor, that is, speaks about work and fabrication.", " The same reification is mentioned in Das Kapital (Vol.", " I, Part 3, ch.", " 5), though somewhat equivocally: \u201c[Die Arbeit] ist vergegenstandlicht und der Gegenstand ist verarbeitet.", "\u201d The play on words with the term Gegenstand obscures what actually happens in the process: through reification, a new thing has been produced, but the \u201cobject\u201d that this process transformed into a thing is, from the viewpoint of the process, Labor ing animal from repeating it all over again and remains therefore an \u201ceternal necessity imposed by nature .", "\u201d 42 When Marx insists that the labor \u201cprocess comes to its end in the product ,\u201d 43 he forgets his own definition of this process as the \u201cmetabolism between man and nature\u201d into which the product is immediately \u201cincorporated,\u201d consumed, and annihilated by the body\u2019s life process.", " Since neither Locke nor Smith is concerned with labor as such, they can afford to admit certain distinctions which actually would amount to a distinction in principle between labor and work, if it were not for an interpretation that treats of the genuine traits of laboring as merely irrelevant.", " Thus, Smith calls \u201cunproductive labor\u201d all activities connected with consumption, as though this were a negligible and accidental trait of something whose true nature was to be productive.", " The very contempt with which he describes how \u201cmenial tasks and services generally perish in the instant of their performance and seldom leave any trace or value behind them \u201d 44 is much more closely related to premodern opinion on this matter than to its modern glorification.", " Smith and Locke were still quite aware of the fact that not every kind of labor \u201cputs the difference of value on everything \u201d 45 and that there exists a kind of activity which adds nothing \u201cto the value of the materials which of man\u2019s own, but the proportion between what nature gives \u2014 the \u201cgood things\u201d \u2014 and what man adds is the very opposite in the products of labor and the products of work.", " The \u201cgood things\u201d for consumption never lose their naturalness altogether, and the grain never quite disappears in the bread as the tree has disappeared in the table.", " Thus, Locke, although he paid little attention to his own distinction between \u201cthe labour of our body and the work of our only material and not a thing.", " (The Engish translation, Modern Library ed.", ", p.", " 201, misses the meaning of the German text and therefore escapes the equivocality.", ") 42.", " This is a recurrent formulation in Marx\u2019s works.", " See, for instance, Das Kapital, Vol.", " I (Modern

to stay long enough in the world of tangible things to become \u201cvaluable,\u201d whereby it is immaterial whether value is defined by Locke as something which can be kept and becomes property or by Smith as something which lasts long enough to be exchangeable for something else.", " These certainly are minor points if compared with the fundamental contradiction which runs like a red thread through the whole of Marx\u2019s thought, and is present no less in the third volume of Capital than in the writings of the young Marx.", " Marx\u2019s attitude toward labor, and that is toward the very center of his thought, has never ceased to be equivocal .", " 48 While it was an \u201ceternal necessity imposed by nature\u201d and the most human and productive of man\u2019s activities, the revolution, according to Marx, has not the task of emancipating the laboring classes but of emancipating man from labor; only when labor is abolished can the \u201crealm of freedom\u201d supplant the \u201crealm of necessity.", "\u201d For \u201cthe realm of freedom begins only where labor determined through want and external utility ceases,\u201d where \u201cthe rule of immediate physical

sophisticated vulgarization, one may remember Marx\u2019s own sovereign attitude toward his work as Kautsky reports it in the following anecdote: Kautsky asked Marx in 1881 if he did not contemplate

loyalty and integrity in describing phenomena as they presented themselves to his view cannot be doubted, the important discrepancies in his work, noted by all Marx scholars, can neither be blamed

no longer necessary.", " We are left with the rather distressing alternative between productive slavery and unproductive freedom.", " Thus, the question arises why Locke and all his successors, their own insights notwithstanding, clung so obstinately to labor as the origin of property, of wealth, of all values and, finally, of the very humanity of man.", " Or, to put it another way, what were the experiences inherent in the laboring activity that proved of such great importance to the modern age? Historically, political theorists from the seventeenth century onward were confronted with a hitherto unheard-of process of growing wealth, growing property, growing acquisition.", " In the attempt to account for this steady growth, their attention was naturally drawn to the phenomenon of a progressing process itself, so that, for reasons we shall have to discuss later , 61 the concept of process became the very key term of the new age as well as the sciences, historical and natural, developed by it.", " From its beginning, this process, because of its apparent endlessness, was understood as a natural process and more specifically in the image of the life process itself.", " The crudest superstition of the modern age \u2014 that \u201cmoney begets money\u201d \u2014 as well as its sharpest political insight \u2014 that power generates power \u2014 owes its plausibility to the underlying metaphor of the natural fertility of life.", " Of all human activities, only labor, and neither

of the same fertile life process.", " Labor was to him the \u201creproduction of one\u2019s own life\u201d which assured the survival of the individual, and begetting was the production \u201cof foreign life\u201d which assured the survival of the species .", " 62 This insight is chronologically the never-forgotten origin of his theory, which he then elaborated by substituting for \u201cabstract labor\u201d the labor power of a living organism and by understanding labor\u2019s surplus as that amount of labor power still extant after the means for the laborer\u2019s own reproduction have been produced.", " With it, he sounded a depth of experience reached by none of his predecessors\u2014 to whom he otherwise owed almost all his decisive inspirations \u2014 and none of his successors.", " He squared his theory, the theory of the modern age, with the oldest and most persistent insights into the nature of labor, which, according to the Hebrew as well as the classical tradition, was as intimately bound up with life as giving birth.", " By the same token, the true meaning of labor\u2019s newly discovered productivity becomes manifest only in Marx\u2019s work, where it rests on the equation of productivity with fertility, so that the famous development of mankind\u2019s \u201cproductive forces\u201d into a society of an abundance of \u201cgood things\u201d actually obeys no other law and is subject to no other necessity than the aboriginal command, \u201cBe ye fruitful and multiply,\u201d in which it is as though the voice of nature herself speaks to us.", " The fertility of the human metabolism with nature, growing out of the natural redundancy of labor power, still partakes of the superabundance we see everywhere in nature\u2019s household.", " The \u201cblessing or the joy\u201d of labor is the human way to experience the sheer bliss of being alive which we share with all living creatures, and it is even the only way men,

sacred and therefore neither death nor labor to be an evil (and least of all an argument against life ), 63 shows in the stories of the patriarchs how unconcerned about death their lives were, how

Hesiod reports that the gods, in order to punish man, hid life from him (see n.", " 8) so that he had to search for it, while before, he apparently did not have to do anything but pluck the fruits of the earth from fields and trees.", " Here the curse consists not only in the harshness of labor but in labor itself.", " of subsistence, so that happiness is a concomitant of the process itself, just as pleasure is a concomitant of the functioning of a healthy body.", " The \u201chappiness of the greatest number,\u201d into which we have generalized and vulgarized the felicity with which earthly life has always been blessed, conceptualized into an \u201cideal\u201d the fundamental reality of a laboring humanity.", " The right to the pursuit of this happiness is indeed as undeniable as the right to life; it is even identical with it.", " But it has nothing in common with good fortune, which is rare and never lasts and cannot be pursued, because fortune depends on luck and what chance gives and takes, although most people in their \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d run after good fortune and make themselves unhappy even when it befalls them, because they want to keep and enjoy luck as though it were an inexhaustible abundance of \u201cgood things.", "\u201d There is no lasting happiness outside the prescribed cycle of painful exhaustion and pleasurable regeneration, and whatever throws this cycle out of balance \u2014poverty and misery where exhaustion is followed by wretchedness instead of regeneration, or great riches and an entirely effortless life where boredom takes the place of exhaustion and where the mills of necessity, of consumption and digestion, grind an impotent human body mercilessly and barrenly to death \u2014 ruins the elemental happiness that comes from being alive.", " The force of life is fertility.", " The living organism is not exhausted when it has provided for its own reproduction, and its \u201csurplus\u201d lies in its potential multiplication.", " Marx\u2019s consistent naturalism discovered \u201clabor power\u201d as the specifically human mode of the life force which is as capable of creating a \u201csurplus\u201d as nature herself.", " Since he was almost exclusively interested in this process itself, the process of the \u201cproductive forces of society,\u201d in whose life, as in the life of every animal species, production and consumption always strike a balance, the question of a separate existence of worldly things, whose durability will survive and withstand the devouring processes of life, does not occur to him at all.", " From the viewpoint of the life of the species, all activities indeed find their common denominator in laboring, and the only distinguishing criterion left is the abundance or scarcity of the goods to be fed into the life process.", " When every thing has become an object for consumption, the fact that labor\u2019s surplus does not Labor change the nature, the \u201cshort duration,\u201d of the products themselves loses all importance, and this loss is manifest in Marx\u2019s work in the contempt with which he treats the belabored distinctions of his predecessors between productive and unproductive, or skilled and unskilled labor.", " The reason why Marx\u2019s predecessors were not able to rid themselves of these distinctions, which essentially are equivalent to the more fundamental distinction between work and labor, was not that they were less \u201cscientific\u201d but that they were still writing on the assumption of private property, or at least individual appropriation of national wealth.", " For the establishment of property, mere abundance can never be enough; labor\u2019s products do not become more durable by their abundance and cannot be \u201cheaped up\u201d and stored away to become part of a man\u2019s property; on the contrary, they are only too likely to disappear in the process of appropriation or to \u201cperish uselessly\u201d if they are not consumed \u201cbefore they spoil.", "\u201d 15 THE PRIVACY OF PROPERTY AND WEALTH At first glance it must seem strange indeed that a theory which so conclusively ended in the abolition of all property should have taken its departure from the theoretical establishment of private property.", " This strangeness, however, is somewhat mitigated if we remember the sharply polemical aspect of the modern age\u2019s concern with property, whose rights were asserted explicitly against the common realm and against the state.", " Since no political theory prior to socialism and communism had proposed to establish an entirely propertyless society, and no government prior to the twentieth century had shown serious inclinations to expropriate its citizens, the content of the new theory could not possibly be prompted by the need to protect property rights against possible intrusion of government administration.", " The point is that then, unlike now when all property theories are obviously on the defensive, the economists were not on the defensive at all but on the contrary openly hostile to the whole sphere of government, which at best was considered a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d and a \u201creflection on human nature ,\u201d 54 at worst a parasite on the otherwise healthy life of society .", " 55 What the modern age so heatedly defended was never property as such but the unhampered pursuit of more property or of appropriation; as against all organs that stood for the \u201cdead\u201d permanence of a common world, it fought its battles in the name of life, the life of society.", " There is no doubt that, as the natural process of life is located in the body, there is no more immediately life-bound activity than laboring.", " Locke could neither remain satisfied with the traditional explanation of labor, according to which it is the natural and inevitable consequence of poverty and never a means of its abolition, nor with the traditional explanation of the origin of property through acquisition, conquest, or an original division of the common world .", " 66 What he actually was concerned with was appropria54.", " The writers of the modern age are all agreed that the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cproductive\u201d side of human nature is reflected in society, while its wickedness makes government necessary.", " As

property was even mutually exclusive, whereas labor and poverty (fonos and penia, Arbeit and Armut) belonged together in the sense that the activity corresponding to the status of poverty was laboring.", " Plato, therefore, who held that laboring slaves were \u201cbad\u201d because they were not masters of the animal part within them, said almost the same about the status of poverty.", " The poor man is \u201cnot master of himself\u201d (penes on kai heautou me baton [Seventh Letter 3 51 A]).", " None of the classical writers ever thought of labor as a possible source of wealth.", " According to Cicero \u2014 and he probably only sums Labor tion and what he had to find was a world-appropriating activity whose privacy at the same time must be beyond doubt and dispute.", " Nothing, to be sure, is more private than the bodily functions of the life process, its fertility not excluded, and it is quite noteworthy that the few instances where even a \u201csocialized mankind\u201d respects and imposes strict privacy concern precisely such \u201cactivities\u201d as are imposed by the life process itself.", " Of these, labor, because it is an activity and not merely a function, is the least private, so to speak, the only one we feel need not be hidden; yet it is still close enough to the life process to make plausible the argument for the privacy of appropriation as distinguished from the very different argument for the privacy of property .", " 67 Locke founded private property on the most privately owned thing there is, \u201cthe property [of man] in his own person,\u201d that is, in his own body .", " 68 \u201cThe labour of our body and the work of our hands\u201d become one and the same, because both are the \u201cmeans\u201d to \u201cappropriate\u201d

common\u201d but are given to each man for his private use .", " 69 Just as Marx had to introduce a natural force, the \u201clabor power\u201d of the body, to account for labor\u2019s productivity and a progressing process of growing wealth, Locke, albeit less explicitly, had to trace property to a natural origin of appropriation in order to force open those stable, worldly boundaries that \u201cenclose\u201d each person\u2019s privately owned share of the world \u201cfrom the common .", "\u201d 60 What Marx still had in common with Locke was that he wished to see the process of growing wealth as a natural process, automatically following its own laws and beyond wilful decisions and purposes.", " If any human activity was to be involved in the process at all, it could only be a bodily \u201cactivity\u201d whose natural functioning could not be checked even if one wanted to do so.", " To check these \u201cactiviup contemporary opinion \u2014 property comes about either

property or considers it to be an impediment to the growth of wealth, a check or control of the process of wealth was equivalent to an attempt to destroy the very life of society.", " The development of the modern age and the rise of society, where the most private of all human activities, laboring, has become public and been permitted to establish its own common realm, may make it doubtful whether the very existence of property as a privately held place within the world can withstand the relentless process of growing wealth.", " But it is true, nevertheless, that the very privacy of one\u2019s holdings, that is, their complete independence \u201cfrom the common,\u201d could not be better guaranteed than by the transformation of property into appropriation or by an interpretation of the \u201cenclosure from the common\u201d which sees it as the result, the \u201cproduct,\u201d of bodily activity.", " In this aspect, the body becomes indeed the quintessence of all property because it is the only thing one could not share even if one wanted to.", " Nothing, in fact, is less common and less communicable, and therefore more securely shielded against the visibility and audibility of the public realm, than what goes on within the confines of the body, its pleasures and its pains, its laboring and consuming.", " Nothing, by the same token, ejects one more radically from the world than exclusive concentration upon the body\u2019s life, a concentration forced upon man in slavery or in the extremity of unbearable pain.", " Whoever wishes, for whatever reason, to make human existence entirely \u201cprivate,\u201d independent of the world and aware only of its own being alive, must rest his arguments on these experiences; and since the relentless drudgery of slave labor is not \u201cnatural\u201d but man-made and in contradiction to the natural fertility of the animal laborans , whose strength is not exhausted and whose time is not consumed when it has reproduced his own life, the \u201cnatural\u201d experience underlying the Stoic as well as the Epicurean independence of the world is not labor or slavery but pain.", " The happiness achieved in isolation from the world and enjoyed within the confines of one\u2019s own private existence can never be anything but the famous \u201cabsence of pain,\u201d a definition on which all variations of consistent sensualism must agree.", " Hedonism, the doctrine that Labor only bodily sensations are real, is but the most radical form of a non-political, totally private way of life, the true fulfilment of Epicurus\u2019 lathe biosas kai me politeuesthai (\u201clive in hiding and do not care about the world\u201d).", " Normally, absence of pain is no more than the bodily condition for experiencing the world; only if the body is not irritated and, through irritation, thrown back upon itself, can our bodily senses function normally, receive what is given to them.", " Absence of pain is usually \u201cfelt\u201d only in the short intermediate stage between pain and non-pain, and the sensation which corresponds to the sensualists\u2019 concept of happiness is release from pain rather than its absence.", " T he intensity of this sensation is beyond doubt; it is, indeed, matched only by the sensation of pain itself .", " 61 The mental effort required by philosophies which for various reasons wish to \u201cliberate\u201d man from the world is always an act of imagination in which the mere absence of pain is experienced and actualized into a feeling of being released from it

to repeat the once experienced pleasure of relief from pain with its intense feeling of euphoria.", " The phenomenon itself was well known in antiquity, whereas in modern literature I found the only support for my assumption in Isak Dinesen\u2019s \u201cConverse at Night in Copenhagen\u201d ( Last Tales [1957], pp.", " 338 ff.", "), where she counts \u201ccessation from pain\u201d among the

\u201cpure pleasure,\u201d let alone mere absence of pain.", " Thus Cicero accused Epicurus of having confused mere absence of pain with the pleasure of release from it (see V.", " Brochard, ttudes de

the concomitant experience of release from pain are the only sense experiences that are so independent from the world that they do not contain the experience of any worldly object.", " The pain caused by a sword or the tickling caused by a feather indeed tells me nothing whatsoever of the quality or even the worldly existence of a sword or a feather .", " 63 Only an irresistible distrust in the capacity of human senses for an adequate experience of the world \u2014 and this distrust is the origin of all specifically modern philosophy\u2014 can explain the strange and even with the help of imagination it can always persuade the body to experience the same pleasure which it once has known\u201d (pp.", " 278 and 294 ff.", ").", " 63.", " It is characteristic of all theories that argue against the world-giving capacity of the senses that they remove vision from its position as the highest and most noble of the senses and substitute touch or taste, which are indeed the most private senses, that is, those in which the body primarily senses itself while perceiving an object.", " All thinkers who deny the reality of the outer world would have agreed with Lucretius, who said: \u201cFor touch and nothing but touch (by all that men call holy) is the essence of all our bodily sensations\u201d {op.", " cit.", ", p.", " 72).", " This, however, is not enough; touch or taste in a non-irritated body still give too much of the reality of the world: when I eat a dish of strawberries, I taste strawberries and not the taste itself, or, to take an example from Galileo, when \u201cI pass a hand, first over a marble statue, then over a living man,\u201d I am aware of marble and a living body, and not primarily of my own hand that touches them.", " Galileo, therefore, when he wishes to demonstrate that the secondary qualities, such as colors, tastes, odors, are \u201cnothing else than mere names example and introduce the sensation of being tickled by a feather, whereupon he concludes: \u201cOf precisely a similar and not greater existence do I believe these various qualities to be possessed, which are attributed to natural bodies, such as tastes, odours, colours and

sense experiences in which the body is clearly thrown back upon itself and therefore, as it were, ejected from the world in which it normally moves.", " The stronger the inner bodily sensation, the more plausible becomes the argument.", " Descartes in the same line of argument says as follows: \u201cThe motion merely of a sword cutting a part of our skin causes pain but does not on that account make us aware of the motion or the figure of the sword.", " And it is certain that this sensation of pain is not less different from the motion that causes it .", " .", " .", " than are the sensation

tickling, obviously prevent our senses\u2019 functioning normally, as examples of all sense experience, and can derive from them the subjectivity of \u201csecondary\u201d and even \u201cprimary\u201d qualities.", " If we had no other sense perceptions than these in which the body senses itself, the reality of the outer world would not only be open to doubt, we would not even possess any notion of a world at all.", " The only activity which corresponds strictly to the experience of worldlessness, or rather to the loss of world that occurs in pain, is laboring, where the human body, its activity notwithstanding, is also thrown back upon itself, concentrates upon nothing but its own being alive, and remains imprisoned in its metabolism with nature without ever transcending or freeing itself from the recurring cycle of its own functioning.", " We mentioned before the twofold pain connected with the life process for which language has but one word and which according to the Bible was imposed upon the life of man together, the painful effort involved in the reproduction of one\u2019s own life and the life of the species.", " If this painful effort of living and fertility were the true origin of property, then the privacy of this property would be indeed as world less as the unequaled privacy of having a body and of experiencing pain.", " This privacy, however, while it is essentially the privacy of appropriation, is by no means what Locke, whose concepts were still essentially those of the premodern tradition, understood by private property.", " No matter what its origin, this property was to him still an \u201cenclosure from the common,\u201d that is, primarily a place in the world where that which is private can be hidden and protected against the public realm.", " As such, it remained in contact with the common world even at a time when growing wealth and appropriation began to threaten the common world with extinction.", " Property does not strengthen but rather mitigates the unrelatedness to the world of the laboring process, because of its own worldly security.", " By the same token, the process character of laboring, the relentlessness with which labor is urged and driven by the life process itself, is checked by the acquisition of property.", " In a society of property-owners, as distinguished from a society of laborers or jobholders, it is still the world, and neither natural abundance nor the sheer necessity of life, which stands at the center of human care and worry.", " The matter becomes altogether different if the leading interest is no longer property but the growth of wealth and the process of accumulation as such.", " This process can be as infinite as the life process of the species, and its very infinity is constantly challenged and interrupted by the inconvenient fact that private individuals do not live forever and have no infinite time before them.", " Only if the life of society as a whole, instead of the limited lives of individual men, is considered to be the gigantic subject of the accumulation process can this process go on in full freedom and at full speed, unhampered by limitations imposed by the individual life-span and individually held property.", " Only when man no longer acts as an individual, concerned only with his own survival, but as a \u201cmember of the species,\u201d a Gattungsivesen as Marx used to say, only when the reproduction of individual life is absorbed into the life process of man-kind, can the collective life process of a \u201csocialized

within ourselves should eventually become the very model of the new concept; within the framework of experiences given to introspection, we know of no other process but the life process within our bodies, and the only activity into which we can translate it and which corresponds to it is labor.", " Labor Hence, it may seem almost inevitable that the equation of productivity with fertility in the labor philosophy of the modern age should have been succeeded by the different varieties of life philosophy which rest on the same equation .", " 64 The difference between the earlier labor theories and the later life philosophies is chiefly that the latter have lost sight of the only activity necessary to sustain the life process.", " Yet even this loss seems to correspond to the factual historical development which made labor more effortless than ever before and therefore even more similar to the automatically functioning life process.", " If at the turn of the century (with Nietzsche and Bergson) life and not labor was proclaimed to be \u201cthe creator of all values,\u201d this glorification of the sheer dynamism of the life process excluded that minimum of initiative

is, the substitution of society or collective man-kind for individual men as its subject, can eliminate the character of strict and even cruel privacy from the experience of bodily processes in which life manifests itself, or from the activity of laboring itself.", " Neither abundance of goods nor the shortening of the time actually spent in laboring are likely to result in the establishment of a common world, and the expropriated animal laborans becomes no less private because he has been deprived of a private place of his own to hide and be protected from the common realm.", " Marx predicted

limitation imposed by the capacity to consume, which remains bound to the individual even when a collective labor force has replaced individual labor power.", " The progress of accumulation of wealth may be limitless in a \u201csocialized mankind\u201d which has rid itself of the limitations of individual property and overcome the limitation of individual appropriation by dissolving all stable

Since mankind as a whole is still very far from having reached the limit of abundance, the mode in which society may overcome this natural limitation of its own fertility can be perceived only tentatively and on a national scale.", " There, the solution seems to be simple enough.", " It consists in treating all use objects as though they were consumer goods, so that a chair or a table is

consumed, instead of work products which are there to be used.", " Just as tools and instruments, Labor though originating from work, were always employed in labor processes as well, so the division of labor, entirely appropriate and attuned to the laboring process, has become one of the chief characteristics of modern work processes, that is, of the fabrication and production of use objects.", " Division of labor rather than increased mechanization has replaced the rigorous specialization formerly required for all workmanship.", " Workmanship is required only for the design and fabrication of models before they go into mass production, which also depends on tools and machinery.", " But mass production would, in addition, be altogether impossible without the replacement of workmen and specialization with laborers and the division of labor.", " Tools and instruments ease pain and effort and thereby change the modes in which the urgent necessity inherent in labor once was manifest to all.", " They do not change the necessity itself; they only serve to hide it from our senses.", " Something similar is true of labor\u2019s products, which do not become more durable through abundance.", " The case is altogether different in the corresponding modern transformation of the work process by the introduction of the principle of division of labor.", " Here the very nature of work is changed and the production process, although it by no means produces objects for consumption, assumes the character of labor.", " Although machines have forced us into an infinitely quicker

laboring.", " Their very abundance transforms them into consumer goods.", " The endlessness of the laboring process is guaranteed by the ever-recurrent needs of consumption; the endlessness of production can be assured only if its products lose their use character and become more and more objects of consumption, or if, to put it in another way, the rate of use is so tremendously accelerated that the objective difference between use and consumption, between the relative durability of use objects and the swift coming and going of consumer goods, dwindles to insignificance.", " In our need for more and more rapid replacement of the worldly things around us, we can no longer afford to use them, to respect and preserve their inherent durability; we must consume, devour, as it were, our houses and furniture and cars as though they were the \u201cgood things\u201d of nature which spoil uselessly if they are not drawn swiftly into the never-ending cycle of man\u2019s metabolism with nature.", " It is as though we had forced open the distinguishing boundaries which protected the world, the human artifice, from nature, the biological process which goes on in its very midst as well as the natural cyclical processes which surround it, delivering and abandoning to them the always threatened stability of a human world.", " The ideals of homo faber , the fabricator of the world, which are permanence, stability, and durability, have been sacrificed to abundance, the ideal of the animal laborans.", " We live in a laborers\u2019 society because only laboring, with its inherent fertility, is likely to bring about abundance; and we have changed work into laboring, broken it up into its minute particles until it has lent itself to division where the common denominator of the simplest performance is reached in order to eliminate from the path of human labor power \u2014 which is part of nature and perhaps even the most powerful of all natural forces\u2014 the obstacle of

and consumption are but two stages of the same process, imposed upon man by the necessity of life, this is only another way of saying that we live in a society of laborers.", " This society did not come about through the emancipation of the laboring classes but by the emancipation of the laboring activity itself, which preceded by centuries the political emancipation of laborers.", " The point is not that for the first time in history laborers were admitted and given equal rights in the public realm, but that we have almost succeeded in leveling all human activities to the common denominator of securing the necessities of life and providing for their abundance.", " Whatever we do, we are supposed to do for the Labor sake of \u201cmaking a living\u201d ; such is the verdict of society, and the number of people, especially in the professions who might challenge it, has decreased rapidly.", " The only exception society is willing to grant is the artist, who, strictly speaking, is the only \u201cworker\u201d left in a laboring society.", " The same trend to level down all serious activities to the status of making a living is manifest in present-day labor theories, which almost unanimously define labor as the opposite of play.", " As a result, all serious activities, irrespective of their fruits, are called labor, and every activity which is not necessary either for the life of the individual or for the life process of society is subsumed under playfulness .", " 75 In these theories, IS.", " Although this labor-play category appears at first glance to be so general as to be meaningless, it is characteristic in another respect: the real opposite underlying it is the opposition of necessity and freedom, and it is indeed remarkable to see how plausible it

categories: (1) Labor is a means to attain a higher end.", " This is generally the Catholic position, which has the great merit of not being able to escape from reality altogether, so that the

extreme, not even the \u201cwork\u201d of the artist is left; it is dissolved into play and has lost its worldly meaning.", " The playfulness of the artist is felt to fulfil the same function in the laboring life process of society as the playing of tennis or the pursuit of a hobby fulfils in the life of the individual.", " The emancipation of labor has not resulted in an equality of this activity with the other activities of the vita activa , but in its almost undisputed predominance.", " From the standpoint of \u201cmaking a living,\u201d every activity unconnected with labor becomes

applied only to slaves, who were subject to necessity anyhow .", " 78 It was the arts of violence, the arts of war, piracy, and ultimately absolute rule, which brought the defeated into the services

danger that the modern age\u2019s emancipation of labor will not only fail to usher in an age of freedom for all but will result, on the contrary, in forcing all mankind for the first time under the

consist in the emancipation of man from labor.", " At first glance, this aim seems utopian, and the only strictly utopian element in Marx\u2019s 80.", " Today, because of the new developments of

so that eventually only the effort of consumption will be left of \u201cthe toil and trouble\u201d inherent in the biological cycle to whose motor human life is bound.", " However, not even this utopia could change the essential worldly futility of the life process.", " The two stages through which the ever-recurrent cycle of biological life must pass, the stages of labor and consumption, may change their proportion even to the point where nearly all human \u201clabor power\u201d is spent in consuming, with the concomitant serious social problem of leisure, that is, essentially the problem of how to provide enough opportunity for daily exhaustion to keep the capacity for consumption intact .", " 84 82.", " The classless and stateless society of Marx is not utopian.", " Quite apart from the fact that modern developments have an unmistakable tendency to do away with class distinctions in society and to replace government by that \u201cadministration of things\u201d which according to

activities connected with mere being alive, the consuming activity no less than the laboring.", " The touchstone of this skhole, as distinguished from the Painless and effortless consumption would not change but would only increase the devouring character of biological life until a mankind altogether \u201cliberated\u201d from the shackles of pain and effort would be free to \u201cconsume\u201d the whole world and to reproduce daily all things it wished to consume.", " How many things would appear and disappear daily and hourly in the life process of such a society would at best be immaterial for the world, if the world and its thing-character could withstand the reckless dynamism of a wholly motorized life process at all.", " The danger of future automation is less the much deplored mechanization and artificialization of natural life than that, its artificiality notwithstanding, all human productivity would be sucked into an enormously intensified life process and would follow automatically, without pain or effort, its ever-recurrent natural cycle.", " The rhythm of machines would magnify and intensify the natural rhythm of life enormously, but it would not change, only make more deadly, life\u2019s chief character with respect to the world, which is to wear down durability.", " It is a long way from the gradual decrease of working hours, which has progressed steadily for nearly a century, to this utopia.", " The progress, moreover, has been rather overrated, because it was measured against the quite exceptionally inhuman conditions of exploitation prevailing during the early stages of capitalism.", " If we think in somewhat longer periods, the total yearly amount of individual free time enjoyed at present appears less an achievement of modernity than a belated approximation to normality .", " 86 In this as modern ideal of leisure, is the well-known and frequently described frugality of Greek life in the classical period.", " Thus, it is characteristic that the maritime trade, which more than anything else was responsible for wealth in Athens, was felt to be suspect, so that Plato, following Hesiod, recommended the foundation of new city-states far away from the sea.", " 85.", " During the Middle Ages, it is estimated that one hardly worked more than half of the days of the year.", " Official holidays numbered 141 days (see

is characteristic of the beginning of the industrial revolution, when the laborers had to compete with newly introduced machines.", " Before that, the length of the working day amounted to eleven or twelve hours in fifteenth-century England and to ten hours in the seventeenth (see H.", " Herkner, \u201cArbeitszeit,\u201d in Handworterbuch fiir die Staatsvoissenschaft [1923], I, 889 ff.", ").", " In Labor in other respects, the specter of a true consumers\u2019 society is more alarming as an ideal of present-day society than as an alr eady existing reality.", " The ideal is not new; it was clearly indicated in the unquestioned assumption of classical political economy that the ultimate goal of the vita activa is growing wealth, abundance, and the \u201chappiness of the greatest number.", "\u201d And what else, finally, is this ideal of modern society but the age-old dream of the poor and destitute, which can have a charm of its own so long as it is a dream, but turns into a fool\u2019s paradise as soon as it is realized.", " The hope that inspired Marx and the best men of the various workers\u2019 movements\u2014 that free time eventually will emancipate men from necessity and make the animal laborans productive \u2014 rests on the illusion of a mechanistic philosophy which assumes that labor power, like any other energy, can never be lost, so that if it is not spent and exhausted in the drudgery of life it will automatically nourish other, \u201chigher,\u201d activities.", " The guiding model of this hope in Marx was doubtless the Athens of Pericles which, in the future, with the help of the vastly increased productivity of human labor, would need no slaves to sustain itself but would become a reality for all.", " A hundred years after Marx we know the fallacy of this reasoning; the spare time of the animal laborans is never spent in anything but consumption, and the more time left to him, the greedier and more craving his appetites.", " That these appetites become more sophisticated, so that consumption is no longer restricted to the necessities but, on the contrary, mainly concentrates on the superfluities of life, does not change the character of this society, but harbors the grave danger that eventually no object of the world will be safe from consumption and annihilation through consumption.", " The rather uncomfortable truth of the matter is that the triumph brief, \u201cles travailleurs ont connu, pendant la premiere moiti^ du 19e siecle, des conditions d\u2019existences pires que celles subies auparavant par les

do not know, of course, but a reflection upon the age of death in the biographies of famous people invites this suspicion.", " the modern world has achieved over necessity is due to the emancipation of labor, that is, to the fact that the animal laborans was permitted to occupy the public realm; and yet, as long as the animal laborans remains in possession of it, there can be no true public realm, but only private activities displayed in the open.", " The outcome is what is euphemistically called mass culture, and its deeprooted trouble is a universal unhappiness, due on one side to the troubled balance between laboring and consumption and, on the other, to the persistent demands of the animal laborans to obtain a happiness which can be achieved only where life\u2019s processes of exhaustion and regeneration, of pain and release from pain, strike a perfect balance.", " The universal demand for happiness and the widespread unhappiness in our society (and these are but two sides of the same coin) are among the most persuasive signs that we have begun to live in a labor society which lacks enough laboring to keep it contented.", " For only the animal laborans, and neither the craftsman nor the man of action, has ever demanded to be \u201chappy\u201d or thought that mortal men could be happy.", " One of the obvious danger signs that we may be on our way to bring into existence the ideal of the animal laborans is the extent to which our whole economy has become a waste economy, in which things must be almost as quickly devoured and discarded as they have appeared in the world, if the process itself is not to come to a sudden catastrophic end.", " But if the ideal were already in existence and we were truly nothing but members of a consumers\u2019 society, we would no longer live in a world at all but simply be driven by a process in whose ever-recurring cycles things appear and disappear, manifest themselves and vanish, never to last long enough to surround the life process in their midst.", " The world, the man-made home erected on earth and made of the material which earthly nature delivers into human hands, consists not of things that are consumed but of things that are used.", " If nature and the earth generally constitute the condition of human life , then the world and the things of the world constitute the condition under which this specifically human life can be at home on earth.", " Nature seen through the eyes of the animal laborans is the great provider of all \u201cgood things,\u201d which belong equally to all her children, who \u201ctake [them] out of [her] hands\u201d and \u201cmix with\u201d Labor them in labor and consumption .", " 86 The same nature seen through the eyes of homo faber, the builder of the world, \u201cfurnishes only the almost worthless materials as in themselves,\u201d whose whole value lies in the work performed upon them .", " 87 Without taking things out of nature\u2019s hands and consuming them, and without defending himself against the natural processes of growth and decay, the animal laborans could never survive.", " But without being at home in the midst of things whose durability makes them fit for use and for erecting a world whose very permanence stands in direct contrast to life, this life would never be human.", " The easier that life has become in a consumers\u2019 or laborers\u2019 society, the more difficult it will be to remain aware of the urges of necessity by which it is driven, even when pain and effort, the outward manifestations of necessity, are hardly noticeable at all.", " The danger is that such a society, dazzled by the abundance of its growing fertility and caught in the smooth functioning of a neverending process, would no longer be able to recognize its own futility\u2014 the futility of a life which \u201cdoes not fix or realize itself in any permanent subject which endures after [its] labour is past .", "\u201d 88

durability Locke needed for the establishment of property, the \u201cvalue\u201d Adam Smith needed for the exchange market, and they bear testimony to productivity, which Marx believed to be the test of human nature.", " Their proper use does not cause them to disappear and they give the human artifice the stability and solidity without which it could not be relied upon to house the unstable and mortal creature which is man.", " The durability of the human artifice is not absolute; the use we make of it, even though we do not consume it, uses it up.", " The life process which permeates our whole being invades it, too, and if we do not use the things of the world, they also will eventually decay, return into the over-all natural process from which they were 1.", " The Latin word faber, probably related to facert (\u201cto make something\u201d in the sense of production), originally designated the fabricator and artist who works upon hard material, such as stone or wood; it also was used as translation for the Greek tekton, which has the same connotation.", " The word fabri, often followed by tignarii, especially designates construction workers and carpenters.", " I have been unable to ascertain when and where the expression homo faber, certainly of modern, postmedieval origin, first appeared.", " Jean Leclercq (\u201cVers la socle te basee sur le travail,\u201d Revue du travail, Vol.", " LI, No.", " 3 [March, 1950]) suggests that only Bergson \u201cthrew the concept of homofaber into the circulation of ideas.", "\u201d Work drawn and against which they were erected.", " If left to itself or discarded from the human world, the chair will again become wood, and the wood will decay and return to the soil from which the tree sprang before it was cut off to become the material upon which to work and with which to build.", " But though this may be the unavoidable end of all single things in the world, the sign of their being products of a mortal maker, it is not so certainly the eventual fate of the human artifice itself, where all single things can be constantly replaced with the change of generations which come and inhabit the man-made world and go away.", " Moreover, while usage is bound to use up these objects, this end is not their destiny in the same way as destruction is the inherent end of all things for consumption.", " What usage wears out is durability.", " It is this durability which gives the things of the world their relative independence from men who produced and use them, their \u201cobjectivity\u201d which makes them withstand, \u201cstand against \u201d 2 and endure, at least for a time, the voracious needs and wants of their living makers and users.", " From this viewpoint, the things of the world have the function of stabilizing human life, and their objectivity lies in the fact that \u2014 in contradiction to the Heraclitean saying that the same man can never enter the same stream\u2014 men, their ever-changing nature notwithstanding, can retrieve their sameness, that is, their identity, by being related to the same chair and the same table.", " In other words, against the subjectivity of men stands the objectivity of the man-made world rather than the sublime indifference of an untouched nature, whose overwhelming elementary force, on the contrary, will compel them to swing relentlessly in the circle of their own biological movement, which fits so closely into the over-all cyclical movement of nature\u2019s household.", " Only we who have erected the objectivity of a world of our own from what nature gives us, who have built it into the environment of nature so that we are protected from her, can look upon nature as something \u201cobjective.", "\u201d Without a world between men and nature, there is eternal movement, but no objectivity.", " Although use and consumption, like work and labor, are not the 2.", " This is implied in the Latin verb obicere, from which our \u201cobject\u201d is a late derivation, and in the German word for object, Gegenstand.", " \u201cObject\u201d means, literally, \u201csomething thrown\u201d or \u201cput against.", "\u201d same, they seem to overlap in certain important areas to such an extent that the unanimous agreement with which both public and learned opinion have identified these two different matters seems well justified.", " Use, indeed, does contain an element of consumption, in so far as the wearing-out process comes about through the contact of the use object with the living consuming organism, and the closer the contact between the body and the used thing, the more plausible will an equation of the two appear.", " If one construes, for instance, the nature of use objects in terms of wearing apparel, he will be tempted to conclude that use is nothing but consumption at a slower pace.", " Against this stands what we mentioned before, that destruction, though unavoidable, is incidental to use but inherent in consumption.", " What distinguishes the most flimsy pair of shoes from mere consumer goods is that they do not spoil if I do not wear them, that they have an independence of their own, however modest, which enables them to survive even for a considerable time the changing moods of their owner.", " Used or unused, they will remain in the world for a certain while unless they are wantonly destroyed.", " A similar, much more famous and much more plausible, argument can be raised in favor of an identification of work and labor.", " The most necessary and elementary labor of man, the tilling of the soil, seems to be a perfect example of labor transforming itself into work in the process, as it were.", " This seems so because tilling the soil, its close relation to the biological cycle and its utter dependence upon the larger cycle of nature notwithstanding, leaves some product behind which outlasts its own activity and forms a durable addition to the human artifice: the same task, performed year in and year out, will eventually transform the wilderness into cultivated land.", " The example figures prominently in all ancient and modern theories of laboring precisely for this reason.", " Yet, despite an undeniable similarity and although doubtless the time-honored dignity of agriculture arises from the fact that tilling the soil not only procures means of subsistence but in this process prepares the earth for the building of the world, even in this case the distinction remains quite clear: the cultivated land is not, properly speaking, a use object, which is there in its own durability and requires for its permanence no more than ordinary care in preservation; the tilled Work soil, if it is to remain cultivated, needs to be labored upon time and again.", " A true reification, in other words, in which the produced thing in its existence is secured once and for all, has never come to pass; it needs to be reproduced again and again in order to remain within the human world at all.", " 19 REIFICATION Fabrication, the work of homo faber, consists in reification.", " Solidity, inherent in all, even the most fragile, things, comes from the material worked upon, but this material itself is not simply given and there, like the fruits of field and trees which we may gather or leave alone without changing the household of nature.", " Material is already a product of human hands which have removed it from its natural location, either killing a life process, as in the case of the tree which must be destroyed in order to provide wood, or interrupting one of nature\u2019s slower processes, as in the case of iron, stone, or marble torn out of the womb of the earth.", " This element of violation and violence is present in all fabrication, and homo faber, the creator of the human artifice, has always been a destroyer of nature.", " The animal laborans, which with its body and the help of tame animals nourishes life, may be the lord and master of all living creatures, but he still remains the servant of nature and the earth; only homo faber conducts himself as lord and master of the whole earth.", " Since his productivity was seen in the image of a Creator-God, so that where God creates ex nihilo, man creates out of given substance, human productivity was by definition bound to result in a Promethean revolt because it could erect a man-made world only after destroying part of God-created nature .", " 3 3.", " This interpretation of human creativity is medieval, whereas the notion of man as lord of the earth is characteristic of the modern age.", " Both are in contradiction to the spirit of the Bible.", " According to the Old Testament, man is the master of all living creatures (Gen.", " 1), which were created to help him (2:19).", " But nowhere is he made the lord and master of the earth; on the contrary, he was put into the garden of Eden to serve and preserve it (2:15).", " It is interesting to note that Luther, consciously rejecting the scholastic compromise with Greek and Latin antiquity, tries to eliminate from human work and labor all elements of production and making.", " Human labor according to him is only \u201cfinding\u201d the The experience of this violence is the most elemental experience of human strength and, therefore, the very opposite of the painful, exhausting effort experienced in sheer labor.", " It can provide selfassurance and satisfaction, and can even become a source of selfconfidence throughout life, all of which are quite different from the bliss which can attend a life spent in labor and toil or from the fleeting, though intense pleasure of laboring itself which comes about if the effort is co-ordinated and rhythmically ordered, and which essentially is the same as the pleasure felt in other rhythmic body movements.", " Most descriptions of the \u201cjoys of labor,\u201d in so far as they are not late reflections of the biblical contented bliss of life and death and do not simply mistake the pride in having done a job with the \u201cjoy\u201d of accomplishing it, are related to the elation felt by the violent exertion of a strength with which man measures himself against the overwhelming forces of the elements and which through the cunning invention of tools he knows how to multiply far beyond its natural measure .", " 4 Solidity is not the result of pleasure or exhaustion in earning one\u2019s bread \u201cin the sweat of his brow,\u201d but of this strength, and it is not simply borrowed or plucked as a free gift from nature\u2019s own eternal presence, although it would be impossible without the material torn out of nature; it is already a product of man\u2019s hands.", " The actual work of fabrication is performed under the guidance of a model in accordance with which the object is constructed.", " This model can be an image beheld by the eye of the mind or a blueprint in which the image has already found a tentative materialization through work.", " In either case, what guides the work of fabrication is outside the fabricator and precedes the actual work treasures God has put into the earth.", " Following the Old Testament, he stresses

description is in flagrant contradiction to the findings of modern psychology, which tell us almost unanimously that the images of the mind are as safely located in our heads as the pangs of hunger are located in our stomachs.", " This subjectivization of modern science, which is only a reflection of an even more radical subjectivization of the modem world, has its justification in this case in the fact that, indeed, most work in the modern world is performed in the mode of labor, so that the worker, even if he wanted to, could not \u201clabor for his work rather than for himself ,\u201d 5 and frequently is instrumental in the production of objects of whose ultimate shape he has not the slightest notion .", " 6 These circumstances, though of great historical importance, are irrelevant in a description of the fundamental articulations of the vita activa.", ") What claims our attention is the veritable gulf that separates all bodily sensations, pleasure or pain, desires and satisfactions \u2014 which are so \u201cprivate\u201d that they cannot even be adequately voiced, much less represented in the outside world, and therefore are altogether incapable of being reified from mental images which lend themselves so easily and naturally to reification that we neither conceive of making a bed without first having some image, some \u201cidea\u201d of a bed before our inner eye, nor can imagine a bed without having recourse to some visual experience of a real thing.", " It is of great importance to the role fabrication came to play within the hierarchy of the vita activa that the image or model whose shape guides the fabrication process not only precedes it, but does not disappear with the finished product, which it survives intact, present, as it were, to lend itself to an infinite continuation of fabrication.", " This potential multiplication, inherent in work, is 5.", " Yves Simon, Trois le C ms sur le travail (Paris, n.", "d.", ") .", " This type of

Multiplication, in distinction from mere repetition, multiplies something that already possesses a relatively stable, relatively permanent existence in the world.", " This quality of permanence in the model or image, of being there before fabrication starts and remaining after it has come to an end, surviving all the possible use objects it continues to help into existence, had a powerful influence on Plato\u2019s doctrine of eternal ideas.", " In so far as his teaching was inspired by the word idea or etdos (\u201cshape\u201d or \u201cform\u201d), which he used for the first time in a philosophical context, it rested on experiences in poiesis or fabrication, and although Plato used his theory to express quite different and perhaps much more \u201cphilosophical\u201d experiences, he never failed to draw his examples from the field of making when he wanted to demonstrate the plausibility of what he was saying .", " 7 7.", " Aristotle\u2019s testimony that Plato introduced the term

introduced into philosophic terminology, even though the word was not current in Attic speech.", " The words eidos and idea doubtlessly relate to visible forms or shapes, especially of living creatures; this makes it unlikely that Plato conceived the doctrine of ideas under the influence of geometrical forms.", " Francis M.", " Cornford\u2019s thesis (Plato and Parmenides [Liberal Arts

knowing soul, apart from the body and the senses,\u201d sounds to me very convincing.", " But my own presentation leaves all such assumptions in abeyance.", " It relates simply to the tenth book of the Republic, where Plato himself explains his doctrine by taking \u201cthe common instance\u201d of a craftsman who makes beds and tables \u201cin accordance with [their] idea,\u201d and then adds, \u201cthat is our way of speaking in this and similar instances.", "\u201d Obviously, to Plato the very word idea was suggestive, Work I lie one eternal idea presiding over a multitude of perishable things derives its plausibility in Plato\u2019s teachings from the permanence and oneness of the model according to which many and perishable objects can be made.", " The process of making is itself entirely determined by the categories of means and end.", " The fabricated thing is an end product in the twofold sense that the production process comes to an end in it (\u201cthe process disappears in the product,\u201d as Marx said) and that it is only a means to produce this end.", " Labor, to be sure, also produces for the end of consumption, but since this end, the thing to be consumed, lacks the worldly permanence of a piece of work, the end of the process is not determined by the end product but rather by the exhaustion of labor power, while the products themselves, on the other hand, immediately become means again, means of subsistence and reproduction of labor power.", " In the process of making, on the contrary, the end is beyond doubt: it has come when an entirely new thing with enough durability to remain in the world as an independent entity has been added to the human artifice.", " As far as the thing, the end product of fabrication, is concerned, the process need not be repeated.", " The impulse toward repeat 1011 comes from the craftsman\u2019s need to earn his means of subsistence, in which case his working coincides with his laboring; or it comes from a demand for multiplication in the market, in which case the craftsman who wishes to meet this demand has added, as Plato would have said, the art of earning money to his craft.", " The point here is that in either case the process is repeated for reasons outside itself and is unlike the compulsory repetition inherent in laboring, where one must eat in order to labor and must labor in order to eat.", " To have a definite beginning and a definite, predictable end is the mark of fabrication, which through this characteristic alone disand he wanted it to suggest \u201cthe craftsman who makes a couch or a table not bylooking .", " at another couch or another table, but by looking at the idea of the couch\u201d (Kurt von Fritz, The Constitution of Athens [1950], pp.", " 34-35).", " Needless to say, none of these explanations touches the root of the matter, that is, the specifically philosophic experience underlying the concept of ideas on the one hand, and their most striking quality on the other \u2014 their illuminating power, their being to phmotaton or ekphanestaton.", " ' tinguishes itself from all other human activities.", " Labor, caught in the cyclical movement of the body\u2019s life process, has neither a beginning nor an end.", " Action, though it may have a definite beginning, never, as we shall see, has a predictable end.", " This great reliability of work is reflected in that the fabrication process, unlike action, is not irreversible: every thing produced by human hands can be destroyed by them, and no use object is so urgently needed in the life process that its maker cannot survive and afford its destruction.", " Homo faber is indeed a lord and master, not only because he is the master or has set himself up as the master of all nature but because he is master of himself and his doings.", " This is true neither of the animal laborans , which is subject to the necessity of its own life, nor of the man of action, who remains in dependence upon his fellow men.", " Alone with his image of the future product, homo faber is free to produce, and again facing alone the work of his hands, he is free to destroy.", " 20 INSTRUMENTALITY AND Animal Laborans From the standpoint of homo faber, who relies entirely on the primordial tools of his hands, man is, as Benjamin Franklin said, a \u201ctool-maker.", "\u201d The same instruments, which only lighten the burden and mechanize the labor of the animal laborans, are designed and invented by homo faber for the erection of a world of things, and their fitness and precision are dictated by such \u201cobjective\u201d aims as he may wish to invent rather than by subjective needs and wants.", " Tools and instruments are so intensely worldly objects that we can classify whole civilizations using them as criteria.", " Nowhere, however, is their worldly character more manifest than when they are used in labor processes, where they are indeed the only tangible things that survive both the labor and the consumption process itself.", " For the animal laborans , therefore, as it is subject to and constantly occupied with the devouring processes of life, the durability and stability of the world are primarily represented in the tools and instruments it uses, and in a society of laborers, tools Work are very likely to assume a more than mere instrumental character or function.", " The frequent complaints we hear about the perversion of ends and means in modern society, about men becoming the servants of the machines they themselves invented and of being \u201cadapted\u201d to their requirements instead of using them as instruments for human needs and wants, have their roots in the factual situation of laboring.", " In this situation, where production consists primarily in preparation for consumption, the very distinction between means and ends, so highly characteristic of the activities of homofaber, simply does not make sense, and the instruments which homo faber invented and with which he came to the help of the labor of the animal laborans therefore lose their instrumental character once they are used by it.", " Within the life process itself, of which laboring remains an integral part and which it never transcends, it is idle to ask questions that presuppose the category of means and end, such as whether men live and consume in order to have strength to labor or whether they labor in order to have the means of consumption.", " If we consider this loss of the faculty to distinguish clearly between means and ends in terms of human behavior, we can say that the free disposition and use of tools for a specific end product is replaced by rhythmic unification of the laboring body with its implement, the movement of laboring itself acting as the unifying force.", " Labor but not work requires for best results a rhythmically ordered performance and, in so far as many laborers gang together, needs a rhythmic co-ordination of all individual movements .", " 8 In 8.", " Karl Bucher\u2019s well-known compilation of rhythmic labor songs in 1897 (Arbeit und Rhythmus [6th ed.", "; 1924]) has been followed by a voluminous literature of a more scientific nature.", " One of the best of these studies (Joseph Schopp, Das deutsche Arbeitslied [1935]) stresses that there exist only labor songs, but no work songs.", " The songs of the craftsmen are social; they are sung after work.", " The fact is, of course, that there exists no \u201cnatural\u201d rhythm for work.", " The striking resemblance between the \u201cnatural\u201d rhythm inherent in every laboring operation and the rhythm of the machines is sometimes noticed, apart from the repeated complaints about the \u201cartificial\u201d rhythm which the machines impose upon the laborer.", " Such complaints, characteristically, are relatively rare among the laborers themselves, who, on the contrary, seem to find the same amount of pleasure in repetitive machine work as in other repetitive labor (see, for instance, Georges Friedmann, Ou va le travail humain? [2d ed.", "; 1953], p.", " 233, and Hendrik de Man, op.", " cit.", ", p.", " 213) .", " This confirms observations which were already made in this motion, the tools lose their instrumental character, and the clear distinction between man and his implements, as well as his ends, becomes blurred.", " What dominates the labor process and all work processes which are performed in the mode of laboring is neither man\u2019s purposeful effort nor the product he may desire, but the motion of the process itself and the rhythm it imposes upon the laborers.", " Labor implements are drawn into this rhythm until body and tool swing in the same repetitive movement, that is, until, in the use of machines, which of all implements are best suited to the performance of the animal laborans, it is no longer the body\u2019s movement that determines the implement\u2019s movement but the machine\u2019s movement which enforces the movements of the body.", " The point is that nothing can be mechanized more easily and less artificially than the rhythm of the labor process, which in its turn corresponds to the equally automatic repetitive rhythm of the life process and its metabolism with nature.", " Precisely because the animal laborans the Ford factories at the beginning of our century.", " Karl Biicher, who believed that \u201crhythmic labor is highly spiritual labor\u201d (vergeistigt ) , already stated: \u201cAufreibencl werden nur solche einformigen Arbeiten, die sich nicht rhythmisch gestalten lassen\u201d (op.", " cit.", ", p.", " 443).", " For though the speed of machine work undoubtedly is much higher and more repetitive than that of \u201cnatural\u201d spontaneous labor, the fact of a rhythmic performance as such makes that machine labor and pre-industrial labor have more in common with each other than either of them has with work.", " Hendrik de Man, for instance, is well aware that \u201cdiese von Biicher .", " .", " .", " gepriesene Welt weniger die des .", " .", " .", " handwerksmassig schopferischen Gewerbes als die der einfachen, schieren .", " .", " .", " Arbeitsfron All these theories appear highly questionable in view of the fact that the workers themselves give an altogether different reason for their preference for repetitive labor.", " They prefer it because it is mechanical and does not demand attention, so that while performing it they can think of something else.", " (They can \u201cgeistig wegtreten,\u201d as Berlin workers formulated it.", " See Thielicke and Pentzlin, Mensch und Arbett im technischen Zeitalter: Zum Problem der Rationalisierung Planck lnstitut fiir Arbeitspsychologie, about 90 per cent of the workers prefer monotonous tasks.", ") This explanation is all the more noteworthy, as it coincides with very early Christian recommendations of the merits of manual labor, which, because it demands less attention, is less likely to interfere with contemplation than other occupations and professions (see litienne Delaruelle, \u201cLe travail dans les regies monastiques occidentales du 4e au 9e siecle,\u201d Journal de psychologic normale et pathologique, Vol.", " XLI, No.", " 1 [1948]).", " Work does not use tools and instruments in order to build a world but in order to ease the labors of its own life process, it has lived literally in a world of machines ever since the industrial revolution and the emancipation of labor replaced almost all hand tools with machines which in one way or another supplanted human labor power with the superior power of natural forces.", " The decisive difference between tools and machines is perhaps best illustrated by the apparently endless discussion of whether man should be \u201cadjusted\u201d to the machine or the machines should be adjusted to the \u201cnature\u201d of man.", " We mentioned in the first chapter the chief reason why such a discussion must be sterile: if the human condition consists in man\u2019s being a conditioned being for whom everything, given or man-made, immediately becomes a condition of his further existence, then man \u201cadjusted\u201d himself to an environment of machines the moment he designed them.", " They certainly have become as inalienable a condition of our existence as tools and implements were in all previous ages .", " The interest of the discussion, from our point of view, therefore, lies rather in the fact that this question of adjustment could arise at all.", " There never was any doubt about man\u2019s being adjusted or needing special adjustment to the tools he used; one might as well have adjusted him to his hands.", " The case of the machines is entirely different.", " Unlike the tools of workmanship, which at every given moment in the work process remain the servants of the hand, the machines demand that the laborer serve them, that he adjust me natural rhythm of his body to their mechanical movement.", " This, certainly, does not imply that men as such adjust to or become the servants of their machines; but it does mean that, as long as the work at the machines lasts, the mechanical process has replaced the rhythm of the human body.", " Even the most refined tool remains a servant, unable to guide or to replace the hand.", " Even the most primitive machine guides the body\u2019s labor and eventually replaces it altogether.", " As is so frequently the case with historical developments, it seems as though the actual implications of technology, that is, of the replacement of tools and implements with machinery, have come to light only in its last stage, with the advent of automation.", " For our purposes it may be useful to recall, however briefly, the main stages of modem technology\u2019s development since the beginning of the modern age.", " The first stage, the invention of the steam engine, which led into the industrial revolution, was still characterized by an imitation of natural processes and the use of natural forces for human purposes, which did not differ in principle from the old use of water and wind power.", " Not the principle of the steam engine was new but rather the discovery and use of the coal mines to feed it .", " 9 The machine tools of this early stage reflect this imitation of naturally known processes; they, too, imitate and put to more powerful use the natural activities of the human hand.", " But today we are told that \u201cthe greatest pitfall to avoid is the assumption that the design aim is reproduction of the hand movements of the operator or laborer .", "\u201d 10 The next stage is chiefly characterized by the use of electricity, and, indeed, electricity still determines the present stage of technical development.", " This stage can no longer be described in terms of a gigantic enlargement and continuation of the old arts and crafts, and it is only to this world that the categories of homo faber , to whom every instrument is a means to achieve a prescribed end, no longer apply.", " For here we no longer use material as nature yields it to us, killing natural processes or interrupting or imitating them.", " In all these instances, we changed and denaturalized nature for our own worldly ends, so that the human world or artifice on one hand and nature on the other remained two distinctly separate entities.", " Today we have begun to \u201ccreate,\u201d as it were,

the philosophy of the earlier stages of the modern age frees itself entirely of the common sense platitudes which we always find where homo faber rules the standards of society.", " The reason is, of course, that Kant did not mean to formulate or conceptualize the tenets of the utilitarianism of his time, but on the contrary wanted first of all to relegate the means-end category to its proper place and prevent its use in the field of political action.", " His formula, however, can no more deny its origin in utilitarian thinking than his other famous and also inherently paradoxical interpretation of man\u2019s attitude toward the only objects that are not \u201cfor use,\u201d namely works of art, in which he said we take \u201cpleasure without any interest .", "\u201d 20 For the same operation which establishes man as the \u201csupreme end\u201d permits him \u201cif he can [to] subject the whole of nature to it ,\u201d 21 that is, to degrade nature and the world into mere means, robbing both of their independent dignity.", " Not even Kant could solve the perplexity or enlighten the blindness of homo faber with respect to the problem of meaning without turning to the paradoxical \u201cend in itself,\u201d and this perplexity lies in the fact that while only fabrication with its instrumentality is capable of building a world, this same world becomes as worthless as the employed material, a mere means for further ends, if the standards which governed its coming into being are permitted to rule it after its establishment.", " Man, in so far as he is homo faber, instrumentalizes, and his instrumentalization implies a degradation of all things into means, their loss of intrinsic and independent value, so that eventually not only the objects of fabrication but also \u201cthe earth in general and all forces of nature,\u201d which clearly came into being without the help of man and have an existence independent of the human world, lose their \u201cvalue because [they] do not present the reification which comes from work .", "\u201d 22 It was for no other reason than this attitude of homo faber to the world that the Greeks in their classical period declared the whole field of the arts and crafts, where men work with instruments and do something not for its own sake but 20.", " Kant\u2019s term is \u201cein Wohlgefallen ohne alles Interesse\u201d

realize that the great masters of Greek sculpture and architecture were by no means excepted from the verdict.", " The issue at stake is, of course, not instrumentality, the use of means to achieve an end, as such, but rather the generalization of the fabrication experience in which usefulness and utility are established as the ultimate standards for life and the world of men.", " This generalization is inherent in the activity of homo faber because the experience of means and end, as it is present in fabrication, does not disappear with the finished product but is extended to its ultimate destination, which is to serve as a use object.", " The instrumentalization of the whole world and the earth, this limitless devaluation of everything given, this process of growing meaninglessness where every end is transformed into a means and which can be stopped only by making man himself the lord and master of all things, does not directly arise out of the fabrication process; for from the viewpoint of fabrication the finished product is as much an end in itself, an independent durable entity with an existence of its own, as man is an end in himself in Kant s political philosophy.", " Only in so far as fabrication chiefly fabricates use objects does the finished product again become a means, and only in so far as the life process takes hold of things and uses them for its purposes does the productive and limited instrumentality of fabrication change into the limitless instrumentalization of everything that exists.", " It is quite obvious that the Greeks dreaded this devaluation of world and nature with its inherent anthropocentrism\u2014 the \u201cabsurd\u201d opinion that man is the highest being and that everything else is subject to the exigencies of human life (Aristotle) -no less than they despised the sheer vulgarity of all consistent utilitarianism.", " To what extent they were aware of the consequences of seeing in homo faber the highest human possibility is perhaps best illustrated by Plato\u2019s famous argument against Protagoras and his apparently self-evident statement that \u201cman is the measure of all use things ( chremata ) , of the existence of those that are, and of the nonexistence of those that are not .", "\u201d 23 (Protagoras evidently did not say: \u201cMan is the measure of all things,\u201d as tradition and the standard translations have made him say.", ") The point of the matter is that Plato saw immediately that if one makes man the measure of all things for use, it is man the user and instrumentalizer, and not man the speaker and doer or man the thinker, to whom the world is being related.", " And since it is in the nature of man the user and instrumentalizer to look upon everything as means to an end\u2014 upon every tree as potential wood\u2014 this must eventually mean that man becomes the measure not only of things whose existence depends upon him but of literally everything there is.", " In this Platonic interpretation, Protagoras in fact sounds like the earliest forerunner of Kant, for if man is the measure of all things, then man is the only thing outside the means-end relationship, the only end in himself who can use everything else as a means.", " Plato knew quite well that the possibilities of producing use objects and of treating all things of nature as potential use objects are as limitless as the wants and talents of human beings.", " If one permits the standards of homo faber to rule the finished world as they must necessarily rule the coming into being of this world, then homo faber will eventually help himself to everything and consider everything that is as a mere means for himself.", " He will judge every thing as though it belonged to the class of chremata, of use objects, so that, to follow Plato\u2019s own example, the wind will no longer be understood in its own right as a natural force but will be considered exclusively in accordance with human needs for warmth or refreshment\u2014 which, of course, means that the wind as something objectively given has been eliminated from human experience.", " It is because of these consequences that Plato, who at the end of his life recalls once more in the Laws the saying of Protagoras, replies with an almost paradoxical formula: not man \u2014 who because of his 23.", " Theaetetus 152, and Cratylus 385E.", " In these instances, as well as in other ancient quotations of the famous saying, Protagoras is always quoted as follows: panton chrbnaton metron

would be rendered in Greek rather as anthropos metron panton , corresponding for instance to Heraclitus\u2019 polemos pater panton (\u201cstrife is the father of all things\u201d).", " Work wants and

on excluding political man, that is, man who acts and speaks, from its public realm as antiquity was on excluding homofaber.", " In both instances the exclusion was not a matter of course, as was the exclusion of laborers and the propertyless classes until their emancipation in the nineteenth century.", " Ihe modern age was of course perfectly aware that the political realm was not always and need

fully capable of having a public realm of his own, even though it may not be a political realm, properly speaking.", " His public realm is the exchange market, where he can show the products of his

finished can he abandon his isolation.", " Historically, the last public realm, the last meeting place which is at least connected with the activity of homo faber, is the exchange market on which his products are displayed.", " The commercial society, characteristic of the earlier stages of the modern age or the beginnings of manufacturing capitalism, sprang from this \u201cconspicuous production\u201d with its concomitant hunger for universal possibilities of truck and barter, and its end came with the rise of labor and the labor society which replaced conspicuous production and its pride with \u201cconspicuous consumption\u201d and its concomitant vanity.", " The people who met on the exchange market, to be sure, were no longer the fabricators themselves, and they did not meet as persons but as owners of commodities and exchange values, as Marx abundantly pointed out.", " In a society where exchange of products has become the chief public activity, even the laborers,

self-alienation, the degradation of men into commodities, sets in, and this degradation is characteristic of labor\u2019s situation in a manufacturing society which judges men not as persons but as producers, according to the quality of their products.", " A laboring society, on the contrary, judges men according to the functions they perform in the labor process; while labor power in the eyes of homo faber is only the means to produce the necessarily higher end, that is, either a use object or an object for exchange, laboring society bestows upon labor power the same higher value it reserves for the machine.", " In other words, this society is only seemingly more \u201chumane,\u201d although it is true that Work under its conditions the price of human labor rises to such an extent that it may seem to be more valued and more valuable than any given material or matter; in fact, it only foreshadows something even more \u201cvaluable,\u201d namely, the smoother functioning of the machine whose tremendous power of processing first standardizes and then devaluates all things into consumer goods.", " Commercial society, or capitalism in its earlier stages when it was still possessed by a fiercely competitive and acquisitive spirit, is still ruled by the standards of homo faber.", " When homo faber comes out of his isolation, he appears as a merchant and trader and establishes the exchange market in this capacity.", " This market must exist prior to the rise of a manufacturing class, which then produces exclusively for the market, that is, produces exchange objects rather than use things.", " In this process from isolated craftsmanship to manufacturing for the exchange market, the finished end product changes its quality somewhat but not altogether.", " Durability, which alone determines if a thing can exist as a thing and endure in the world as a distinct entity, remains the supreme criterion, although it no longer makes a thing fit for use but rather fit to \u201cbe stored up beforehand\u201d for future exchange .", " 30 This is the change in quality reflected in the current distinction between use and exchange value, whereby the latter is related to the former as the merchant and trader is related to the fabricator and manufacturer.", " In so far as homo faber fabricates use objects, he not only produces them in the privacy of isolation but also for the privacy of usage, from which they emerge and appear in the public realm when they become commodities in the exchange market.", " It has frequently been remarked and

these sins of a commercial society, where indeed the exchange market is the most important public place and where therefore every thing becomes an exchangeable value, a commodity, Marx did not summon up the \u201cintrinsick\u201d objective worth of the thing in itself.", " In its stead he put the function things have in the consuming life process of men which knows neither objective and intrinsic worth nor subjective and socially determined value.", " In the socialist equal distribution of all goods to all who labor, every tangible thing dissolves into a mere function in the regeneration process of life and labor power.", " However, this verbal confusion tells only one part of the story.", " The reason for Marx\u2019s stubborn retention of the term \u201cuse value,\u201d as well as for the numerous futile attempts to find some objective source \u2014 such as labor, or land, or profit \u2014 for the birth of values, was that nobody found it easy to accept the simple fact that no \u201cabsolute value\u201d exists in the exchange market, which is the proper sphere for values, and that to look for it resembled nothing so much as the attempt to square the circle.", " The much deplored devaluation of all things, that is, the loss of all intrinsic worth, begins with their transformation into values or commodities, for from this moment on they exist only in relation to some

intrinsic worth, that nothing any longer possesses an \u201cobjective\u201d value independent of the ever-changing estimations of supply and demand, are inherent in the very concept of value itself .", " 38 The reason why this development, which seems inevitable in a commercial society, became a deep source of uneasiness and eventually constituted the chief problem of the new science of economics was not even relativity as such, but rather the fact that homo faber, whose whole activity is determined by the constant use of yardsticks, measurements, rules, and standards, could not bear the loss of \u201cabsolute\u201d standards or yardsticks.", " For money, which obviously serves as the common denominator for the variety of things so that they can be exchanged for each other, by no means possesses the independent and objective existence, transcending all uses and surviving all manipulation, that the yardstick or any other measurement possesses with regard to the things it is supposed to measure and to the men who handle them.", " It is this loss of standards and universal rules, without which no world could ever be erected by man, that Plato already perceived in the Protagorean proposal to establish man, the fabricator of things, and the use he makes of them, as their supreme measure.", " This shows how closely the relativity of the exchange market is connected with the instrumentality arising out of the world of the craftsman and the experience of fabrication.", " The former, indeed, develops without break and consistently from the latter.", " Plato\u2019s reply, however \u2014 not man, a \u201cgod is the measure of all things\u201d 38.", " The truth of Ashley\u2019s remark, which we quoted above (n.", " 34), lies in the fact that the Middle Ages did not know the exchange market, properly speaking.", " To the medieval teachers the value of a thing was either determined by its worth or by the objective needs of men\u2014 as for instance in Buridan: valor rerum aestimatur secundum humanam indigentiam \u2014 and the \u201cjust price\u201d was normally the result of the common estimate, except tha t \u201con account of the varied and corrupt desires of man, it becomes expedient that the medium should be fixed according to the judgment of some wise men\u201d (Gerson De contractibus i.", " 9, quoted from O\u2019Brien, op.", " cit.", ", pp.", " 104 ff.", ").", " In the absence of an exchange market, it was inconceivable that the value of one thing should consist solely in its relationship or proportion to another thing.", " The question, therefore, is not so much whether value is objective or subjective, but whether it can be absolute or indicates only the relationship between things.", " Work \u2014 would be an empty, moralizing gesture if it were really true, as the modern age assumed, that instrumentality under the disguise of usefulness rules the realm of the finished world as exclusively as it rules the activity through which the world and all things it contains came into being.", " 23 THE PERMANENCE OF THE WORLD AND THE WORK OF ART Among the things that give the human artifice the stability without which it could never be a reliable home for men are a number of objects which are strictly without any utility whatsoever and which, moreover, because they are unique, are not exchangeable and therefore defy equalization through a common denominator such as money; if they enter the exchange market, they can only be arbitrarily priced.", " Moreover, the proper intercourse with a work of art is certainly not \u201cusing\u201d it; on the contrary, it must be removed carefully from the whole context of ordinary use objects to attain its proper place in the world.", " By the same token, it must be removed from the exigencies and wants of daily life, with which it has less contact than any other thing.", " Whether this uselessness of art objects has always pertained or whether art formerly served the so-called religious needs of men as ordinary use objects serve more ordinary needs does not enter the argument.", " Even if the historical origin of art were of an exclusively religious or mythological character, the fact is that art has survived gloriously its severance from religion, magic, and myth.", " Because of their outstanding permanence, works of art are the most intensely worldly of all tangible things; their durability is almost untouched by the corroding effect of natural processes, since they are not subject to the use of living creatures, a use which, indeed, far from actualizing their own inherent purpose\u2014 as the purpose of a chair is actualized when it is sat upon\u2014 can only destroy them.", " Thus, their durability is of a higher order than that which all things need in order to exist at all; it can attain permanence throughout the ages.", " In this permanence, the very stability of the human artifice, which, being inhabited and used by mortals, can never be absolute, achieves a representation of its own.", " Nowhere else does the sheer durability of the world of things appear in such purity and clarity, nowhere else therefore does this thingworld reveal itself so spectacularly as the non-mortal home for mortal beings.", " It is as though worldly stability had become transparent in the permanence of art, so that a premonition of immortality, not the immortality of the soul or of life but of something immortal achieved by mortal hands, has become tangibly present, to shine and to be seen, to sound and to be heard, to speak and to be read.", " The immediate source of the art work is the human capacity for thought, as man\u2019s \u201cpropensity to truck and barter\u201d is the source of exchange objects, and as his ability to use is the source of use things.", " These are capacities of man and not mere attributes of the human animal like feelings, wants, and needs, to which they are related and which often constitute their content.", " Such human properties are as unrelated to the world which man creates as his home on earth as the corresponding properties of other animal species, and if they were to constitute a man-made environment for the human animal, this would be a non-world, the product of emanation rather than of creation.", " Thought is related to feeling and transforms its mute and inarticulate despondency, as exchange transforms the naked greed of desire and usage trans forms the desperate longing of needs \u2014 until they all are fit to enter the world and to be transformed into things, to become reified.", " In each instance, a human capacity which by its very nature is world-open and communicative transcends and releases into the world a passionate intensity from its imprisonment within the self.", " In the case of art works, reification is more than mere transformation; it is transfiguration, a veritable metamorphosis in which it is as though the course of nature which wills that all fire burn to ashes is reverted and even dust can burst into flames .", " 89 Works of 39.", " The text refers to a poem by Rilke on art, which under the title \u201cMagic,\u201d describes this transfiguration.", " It reads as follows: \u201cAus unbeschreiblicher Verwandlung stammen / solche Gebilde \u2014 : Fiihl! und glaub! / Wir leidens oft: zu Asche werden Flammen, / doch, in der Kunst: zur Flamme wird der Staub.", " / Hier ist Magie.", " In das Bereich des Zaubers / scheint das gemeine Wort hinaufgestuft .", " .", " .", " / und ist doch wirklich wie der Ruf des Taubers, / der nach der unsichtbaren Taube ruft\u201d (in Aus Taschen-Biichem und Merk-Bldttem [19 JO]).", " Work art are thought things, but this does not prevent their being things.", " The thought process by itself no more produces and fabricates tangible things, such as books, paintings, sculptures, or compositions, than usage by itself produces and fabricates houses and furniture.", " The reification which occurs in writing something down, painting an image, modeling a figure, or composing a melody is of course related to the thought which preceded it, but what actually makes the thought a reality and fabricates things of thought is the same workmanship which, through the primordial instrument of human hands, builds the other durable things of the human artifice.", " We mentioned before that this reification and materialization, without which no thought can become a tangible thing, is always paid for, and that the price is life itself: it is always the \u201cdead letter\u201d in which the \u201cliving spirit\u201d must survive, a deadness from which it can be rescued only when the dead letter comes again into contact with a life willing to resurrect it, although this resurrection of the dead shares with all living things that it, too, will die again.", " This dcadness, however, though somehow present in all art and indicating, as it were, the distance between thought\u2019s original home in the heart or head of man and its eventual destination in the world, varies in the different arts.", " In music and poetry, the least \u201cmaterialistic\u201d of the arts because their \u201cmaterial\u201d consists of sounds and words, reification and the workmanship it demands are kept to a minimum.", " The young poet and the musical child prodigy can attain a perfection without much training and experience \u2014 a phenomenon hardly matched in painting, sculpture, or architecture.", " Poetry, whose material is language, is perhaps the most human and least worldly of the arts, the one in which the end product remains closest to the thought that inspired it.", " The durability of a poem is produced through condensation, so that it is as though language spoken in utmost density and concentration were poetic in itself.", " Here, remembrance, Mnemosyne , the mother of the muses, is directly transformed into memory, and the poet\u2019s means to achieve the transformation is rhythm, through which the poem becomes fixed in the recollection almost by itself.", " It is this closeness to living recollection that enables the poem to remain, to retain its durability, outside the printed or the written page, and though the \u201cquality\u201d of a poem may be subject to a variety of standards, its \u201cmemorability\u201d will inevitably determine its durability, that is, its chance to be permanently fixed in the recollection of humanity.", " Of all things of thought, poetry is closest to thought, and a poem is less a thing than any other work of art; yet even a poem, no matter how long it existed as a living spoken word in the recollection of the bard and those who listened to him, will eventually be \u201cmade,\u201d that is, written down and transformed into a tangible thing among things, because remembrance and the gift of recollection, from which all desire for imperishability springs, need tangible things to remind them, lest they perish themselves .", " 40 Thought and cognition are not the same.", " Thought, the source of art works, is manifest without transformation or transfiguration in all great philosophy, whereas the chief manifestation of the cognitive processes, by which we acquire and store up knowledge, is the sciences.", " Cognition always pursues a definite aim, which can be set by practical considerations as well as by \u201cidle curiosity\u201d; but once this aim is reached, the cognitive process has come to an end.", " Thought, on the contrary, has neither an end nor an aim outside itself, and it does not even produce results; not only the utilitarian philosophy of homo faber but also the men of action and the lovers of results in the sciences have never tired of pointing out how entirely \u201cuseless\u201d thought is \u2014 as useless, indeed, as the works of art it inspires.", " And not even to these useless products can thought lay claim, for they as well as the great philosophic systems can hardly be called the results of pure thinking, strictly speaking, since it is precisely the thought process which the artist or writing philosopher must interrupt and transform for the materializing reification 40.", " The Idiomatic \u201cmake a poem\u201d or fair e des vers for the activity of the poet already relates to this reification.", " The same is true for the German dichten, which probably comes from the Latin dictare: \u201cdas ausgesonnene geistig Geschaffene niederschreiben oder zum Niederschreiben vorsagen\u201d (Grimm\u2019s Worterbuch) ; the same would be true if the word were derived, as is now suggested by the Etymologisches Worterbuch (1951) of Kluge/Gotze, from tichen, an old word for schajfen, which is perhaps related to the Latin fingere.", " In this case, the poetic activity which produces the poem before it is written down is also understood as \u201cmaking.", "\u201d Thus Democritus praised the divine genius of Homer, who \u201cframed a cosmos out of all kinds of words\u201d \u2014 epeon kosmon etektenato pantoion (Diels, op.", " cit.", ", B21).", " The same emphasis on the craftsmanship of poets is present in the Greek idiom for the art of poetry: tektones hymnon.", " Work of his work.", " The activity of thinking is as relentless and repetitive as life itself, and the question whether thought has any meaning at all constitutes the same unanswerable riddle as the question for the meaning of life; its processes permeate the whole of human existence so intimately that its beginning and end coincide with the beginning and end of human life itself.", " Thought, therefore, although it inspires the highest worldly productivity of homo faber, is by no means his prerogative; it begins to assert itself as his source of inspiration only where he overreaches himself, as it were, and begins to produce useless things, objects which are unrelated to material or intellectual wants, to man\u2019s physical needs no less than to his thirst for knowledge.", " Cognition, on the other hand, belongs to all, and not only to intellectual or artistic work processes; like fabrication itself, it is a process with a beginning and end, whose usefulness can be tested, and which, if it produces no results, has failed, like a carpenter\u2019s workmanship has failed when he fabricates a two-legged table.", " The cognitive processes in the sciences are basically not different from the function of cognition in fabrication; scientific results produced through cognition are added to the human artifice like all other things.", " Both thought and cognition, furthermore, must be distinguished from the power of logical reasoning which is manifest in such operations as deductions from axiomatic or self-evident statements, subsumption of particular occurrences under general rules, or the techniques of spinning out consistent chains of conclusions.", " In these human faculties we are actually confronted with a sort of brain power which in more than one respect resembles nothing so much as the labor power the human animal develops in its metabolism with nature.", " The mental processes which feed on brain power we usually call intelligence, and this intelligence can indeed be measured by intelligence tests as bodily strength can be measured by other devices.", " Their laws, the laws of logic, can be discovered like other laws of nature because they are ultimately rooted in the structure of the human brain, and they possess, for the normally healthy individual, the same force of compulsion as the driving necessity which regulates the other functions of our bodies.", " It is in the structure of the human brain to be compelled to admit that two and two equal four.", " If it were true that man is an animal rationale in the sense in which the modern age understood the term, namely, an animal species which differs from other animals in that it is endowed with superior brain power, then the newly invented electronic machines, which, sometimes to the dismay and sometimes to the confusion of their inventors, are so spectacularly more \u201cintelligent\u201d than human beings, would indeed be homunculi.", " As it is, they are, like all machines, mere substitutes and artificial improvers of human labor power, following the time-honored device of all division of labor to break down every operation into its simplest constituent motions, substituting, for instance, repeated addition for multiplication.", " The superior power of the machine is manifest in its speed, which is far greater than that of human brain power; because of this superior speed, the machine can dispense with multiplication, which is the pre-electronic technical device to speed up addition.", " All that the giant computers prove is that the modern age was wrong to believe with Hobbes that rationality, in the sense of \u201creckoning with consequences,\u201d is the highest and most human of man\u2019s capacities, and that the life and labor philosophers, Marx or Bergson or Nietzsche, were right to see in this type of intelligence, which they mistook for reason, a mere function of the life process itself, or, as Hume put it, a mere \u201cslave of the passions.", "\u201d Obviously, this brain power and the compelling logical processes it generates are not capable of erecting a world, are as worldless as the compulsory processes of life, labor, and consumption.", " One of the striking discrepancies in classical economics is that the same theorists who prided themselves on the consistency of their utilitarian outlook frequently took a very dim view of sheer utility.", " As a rule, they were well aware that the specific productivity of work lies less in its usefulness than in its capacity for producing durability.", " By this discrepancy, they tacitly admit the lack of realism in their own utilitarian philosophy.", " For although the durability of ordinary things is but a feeble reflection of the permanence of which the most worldly of all things, works of art, are capable, something of this quality \u2014 which to Plato was divine because it approaches immortality\u2014 is inherent in every thing as a thing, and it is precisely this quality or the lack of it that shines forth in its shape and makes it beautiful or ugly.", " To be sure, an ordinary use object is not and should not be intended to be beautiful; yet whatWork ever has a shape at all and is seen cannot help being either beautiful, ugly, or something in-between.", " Everything that is, must appear, and nothing can appear without a shape of its own; hence there is in fact no thing that does not in some way transcend its functional use, and its transcendence, its beauty or ugliness, is identical with appearing publicly and being seen.", " By the same token, namely, in its sheer worldly existence, every thing also transcends the sphere of pure instrumentality once it is completed.", " 1 he standard by which a thing\u2019s excellence is judged is never mere usefulness, as though an ugly table will fulfil the same function as a handsome one, but its adequacy or inadequacy to what it should look like, and this is, in Platonic language, nothing but its adequacy or inadequacy to the eidos or idea, the mental image, or rather the image seen by the inner eye, that preceded its coming into the world and survives its potential destruction.", " In other words, even use objects are judged not only according to the subjective needs of men but by the objective standards of the world where they will find their place, to last, to be seen, and to be used.", " The man-made world of things, the human artifice erected by homo faber, becomes a home for mortal men, whose stability will endure and outlast the ever-changing movement of their lives and actions, only insomuch as it transcends both the sheer functionalism of things produced for consumption and the sheer utility of objects produced for use.", " Life in its non-biological sense, the span of time each man has between birth and death, manifests itself in action and speech, both of which share with life its essential futility.", " The \u201cdoing of great deeds and the speaking of great words\u201d will leave no trace, no product that might endure after the moment of action and the spoken word has passed.", " If the animal laborans needs the help of homo faber to ease his labor and remove his pain, and if mortals need his help to erect a home on earth, acting and speaking men need the help of homo faber in his highest capacity, that is, the help of the artist, of poets and historiographers, of monument-builders or writers, because without them the only product of their activity, the story they enact and tell, would not survive at all.", " In order to be what the world is always meant to be, a home for men during their life on earth, the human artifice must be a place fit for action and speech, for activities not only entirely useless for the necessities of life but of an entirely different nature from the manifold activities of fabrication by which the world itself and all things in it are produced.", " We need not choose here between Plato and Protagoras, or decide whether man or a god should be the measure of all things; what is certain is that the measure can be neither the driving necessity of biological life and labor nor the utilitarian instrumentalism of fabrication and usage.", " CHAPTER V

twofold character of equality and distinction.", " If men were not equal, they could neither understand each other and those who came before them nor plan for the future and foresee the needs of those who will come after them.", " If men were not distinct, each human being distinguished from any other who is, was, or will ever be, they would need neither speech nor action to make themselves understood.", " Signs and sounds to communicate immediate, identical needs and wants would be enough.", " Human distinctness is not the same as otherness-\u2014 the curious quality of alteritas possessed by everything that is and therefore, in medieval philosophy, one of the four basic, universal characteristics of Being, transcending every particular quality.", " Otherness, it is true, is an important aspect of plurality, the reason why all our definitions are distinctions, why we are unable to say what anything is without distinguishing it from something else.", " Otherness in its most abstract form is found only in the sheer multiplication of inorganic objects, whereas all organic life already shows variations and distinctions, even between specimens of the same species.", " But only man can express this distinction and distinguish himself, and only he can communicate himself and not merely something \u2014 thirst or hunger, affection or hostility or fear.", " In man, otherness, which he shares with everything that is, and distinctness, which he shares with everything alive, become uniqueness, and human plurality is the paradoxical plurality of unique beings.", " Speech and action reveal this unique distinctness.", " Through them, men distinguish themselves instead of being merely distinct; they are the modes in which human beings appear to each other, not indeed as physical objects, but qua men.", " This appearance, as distinguished from mere bodily existence, rests on initiative, but it is an initiative from which no human being can refrain and still be human.", " This is true of no other activity in the vita activa.", " Men can very well live without laboring, they can | force others to labor for them, and they can very well decide merely to use and enjoy the world of things without themselves adding a single useful object to it; the life of an exploiter or slaveholder and the life of a parasite may be unjust, but they certainly are human.", " A life without speech and without action, on the other hand \u2014 and this is the only way of life that in earnest has renounced all appearance and all vanity in the biblical sense of the word\u2014 is literally dead to the world; it has ceased to be a human life because it is no longer lived among men.", " With word and deed we insert ourselves into the human world, and this insertion is like a second birth, in which we confirm and take upon ourselves the naked fact of our original physical apAction pearance.", " This insertion is not forced upon us by necessity, like labor, and it is not prompted by utility, like work.", " It may be stimulated by the presence of others whose company we may wish to join, but it is never conditioned by them; its impulse springs from the beginning which came into the world when we were born and to which we respond by beginning something new on our own initiative .", " 1 To act, in its most general sense, means to take an initiative, to begin (as the Greek word archein, \u201cto begin,\u201d \u201cto lead,\u201d and eventually \u201cto rule,\u201d indicates), to set something into motion (which is the original meaning of the Latin agere).", " Because they are initium , newcomers and beginners by virtue of birth, men take initiative, are prompted into action.", " [ Initium ] ergo vt esset, creatus est homo, ante quem nullus fuit

3 it is not the beginning of something but of somebody, who is a beginner himself.", " With the creation of man, the principle of beginning came into the world itself, which, of course, is only another way of saying that the principle of freedom was created when man was created but not before.", " It is in the nature of beginning that something new is started 1 .", " This description is supported by recent findings in psychology and biology which also stress the inner affinity between speech and action, their spontaneity and practical purposelessness.", " See especially Arnold Gehlen, Der Mensch: Seine Natur und seine Stellung in der Welt (1955), which gives an excellent summary of the results and interpretations of current scientific research and contains a wealth of valuable insights.", " That Gehlen, like the scientists upon whose results he bases his own theories, believes that these specifically human capabilities are also a \u201cbiological necessity,\u201d

not mean that nothing was made before (for the angels were),\u201d whereas he adds explicitly in the phrase quoted above with reference to man that nobody was before him.", " which cannot be expected from whatever may have happened before.", " This character of startling unexpectedness is inherent in all beginnings and in all origins.", " Thus, the origin of life from inorganic matter is an infinite improbability of inorganic processes, as is the coming into being of the earth viewed from the standpoint of processes in the universe, or the evolution of human out of animal life.", " The new always happens against the overwhelming odds of statistical laws and their probability, which for all practical, everyday purposes amounts to certainty; the new therefore always appears in the guise of a miracle.", " 1 he fact that man is capable of action means that the unexpected can be expected from him, that he is able to perform what is infinitely improbable.", " And this again is possible only because each man is unique, so that with each birth something uniquely new comes into the world.", " With respect to this somebody who is unique it can be truly said that nobody was there before.", " If action as beginning corresponds to the fact of birth, if it is the actualization of the human condition of natality, then speech corresponds to the fact of distinctness and is the actualization of the human condition of plurality, that is, of living as a distinct and unique being among equals.", " Action and speech are so closely related because the primordial and specifically human act must at the same time contain the answer to the question asked of every newcomer: \u201cWho are you?\u201d This disclosure of who somebody is, is implicit in both his words and his deeds; yet obviously the affinity between speech and revelation is much closer than that between action and revelation, 4 just as the affinity between action and beginning is closer than that between speech and beginning, although many, and even most acts, are performed in the manner of speech.", " Without the accompaniment of speech, at any rate, action would not only lose its revelatory character, but, and by the same token, it would lose its subject, as it were; not acting men but performing robots would achieve what, humanly speaking, would remain incomprehensible.", " Speechless action would no longer be action because there would no longer be an actor, and the actor, the doer of 4.", " This is the reason why Plato says that lexis (\u201cspeech\u201d) adheres more closely to truth than praxis.", " Action deeds, is possible only if he is at the same time the speaker of words.", " The action he begins is humanly disclosed by the word, and though his deed can be perceived in its brute physical appearance without verbal accompaniment, it becomes relevant only through the spoken word in which he identifies himself as the actor, announcing what he does, has done, and intends to do.", " No other human performance requires speech to the same extent as action.", " In all other performances speech plays a subordinate role, as a means of communication or a mere accompaniment to something that could also be achieved in silence.", " It is true that speech is extremely useful as a means of communication and information, but as such it could be replaced by a sign language, which then might prove to be even more useful and expedient to convey certain meanings, as in mathematics and other scientific disciplines or in certain forms of teamwork.", " Thus, it is also true that man\u2019s capacity to act, and especially to act in concert, is extremely useful for purposes of self-defense or of pursuit of interests; but if nothing more were at stake here than to use action as a means to an end, it is obvious that the same end could be much more easily attained in mute violence, so that action seems a not very efficient substitute for violence, just as speech, from the viewpoint of sheer utility, seems an awkward substitute for sign language.", " In acting and speaking, men show who they are, reveal actively their unique personal identities and thus make their appearance in the human world, while their physical identities appear without any activity of their own in the unique shape of the body and sound of the voice.", " This disclosure of \u201cwho\u201d in contradistinction to \u201cwhat\u201d somebody is \u2014 his qualities, gifts, talents, and shortcomings, which he may display or hide \u2014 is implicit in everything somebody says and does.", " It can be hidden only in complete silence and perfect passivity, but its disclosure can almost never be achieved as a wilful purpose, as though one possessed and could dispose of this \u201cwho\u201d in the same manner he has and can dispose of his qualities.", " On the contrary, it is more than likely that the \u201cwho,\u201d which appears so clearly and unmistakably to others, remains hidden from the person himself, like the daimon in Greek religion which accompanies each man throughout his life, always looking over his shoulder from behind and thus visible only to those he encounters.", " This revelatory quality of speech and action comes to the fore where people are with others and neither for nor against them \u2014 that is, in sheer human togetherness.", " Although nobody knows whom he reveals when he discloses himself in deed or word, he must be willing to risk the disclosure, and this neither the doer of good works, who must be without self and preserve complete anonymity, nor the criminal, who must hide himsell: from others, can take upon themselves.", " Both are lonely figures, the one being for, the other against, all men; they, therefore, remain outside the pale of human intercourse and are, politically, marginal figures who usually enter the historical scene in times of corruption, disintegration, and political bankruptcy.", " Because of its inherent tendency to disclose the agent together with the act, action needs for its full appearance the shining brightness we once called glory, and which is possible only in the public realm.", " Without the disclosure of the agent in the act, action loses its specific character and becomes one form of achievement among others.", " It is then indeed no less a means to an end than making is a means to produce an object.", " This happens whenever human togetherness is lost, that is, when people are only for or against other people, as for instance in modern warfare, where men go into action and use means of violence in order to achieve certain objectives for their own side and against the enemy.", " In these instances, which of course have always existed, speech becomes indeed \u201cmere talk,\u201d simply one more means toward the end, whether it serves to deceive the enemy or to dazzle everybody with propaganda; here words reveal nothing, disclosure comes only from the deed itself, and this achievement, like all other achievements, cannot disclose the \u201cwho,\u201d the unique and distinct identity of the agent.", " In these instances action has lost the quality through which it transcends mere productive activity, which, from the humble making of use objects to the inspired creation of art works, has no more meaning than is revealed in the finished product and does not intend to show more than is plainly visible at the end of the production process.", " Action without a name, a \u201cwho\u201d attached to Action it, is meaningless, whereas an art work retains its relevance whether or not we know the master\u2019s name.", " The monuments to the \u201cUnknown Soldier\u201d after World War I bear testimony to the then still existing need for glorification, for finding a \u201cwho,\u201d an identifiable somebody whom four years of mass slaughter should have revealed.", " The frustration of this wish and the unwillingness to resign oneself to the brutal fact that the agent of the war was actually nobody inspired the erection of the monuments to the \u201cunknown,\u201d to all those whom the war had failed to make known and had robbed thereby, not of their achievement, but of their human dignity .", " 5 25 THE WEB OF RELATIONSHIPS AND THE ENACTED STORIES The manifestation of who the speaker and doer unexchangeably is, though it is plainly visible, retains a curious intangibility that confounds all efforts toward unequivocal verbal expression.", " The moment we want to say who somebody is, our very vocabulary leads us astray into saying what he is; we get entangled in a description of qualities he necessarily shares with others like him; we begin to describe a type or a \u201ccharacter\u201d in the old meaning of the word, with the result that his specific uniqueness escapes us.", " This frustration has the closest affinity with the well-known philosophic impossibility to arrive at a definition of man, all definitions being determinations or interpretations of what man is, of qualities, therefore, which he could possibly share with other living beings, whereas his specific difference would be found in a determination of what kind of a \u201cwho\u201d he is.", " Yet apart from this philosophic perplexity, the impossibility, as it were, to solidify in words the living essence of the person as it shows itself in the flux of action and speech, has great bearing upon the whole realm of human affairs, where we exist primarily as acting and speaking beings.", " It excludes in principle our ever being able to handle these affairs as we handle things whose nature is at our 5.", " William Faulkner\u2019s A Fable (1954) surpasses almost all of World War I literature in perceptiveness and clarity because its hero is the Unknown Soldier.", " disposal because we can name them.", " The point is that the manifestation of the \u201cwho\u201d comes to pass in the same manner as the notoriously unreliable manifestations of ancient oracles, which, according to Heraclitus, \u201cneither reveal nor hide in words, but give manifest signs .", "\u201d 6 This is a basic factor in the equally notorious uncertainty not only of all political matters, but of all affairs that go on between men directly, without the intermediary, stabilizing, and solidifying influence of things .", " 7 This is only the first of many frustrations by which action, and consequently the togetherness and intercourse of men, are ridden.", " It is perhaps the most fundamental of those we shall deal with, in so far as it does not rise out of comparisons with more reliable and productive activities, such as fabrication or contemplation or cognition or even labor, but indicates something that frustrates action in terms of its own purposes.", " What is at stake is the revelatory character without which action and speech would lose all human relevance.", " Action and speech go on between men, as they are directed toward them, and they retain their agent-revealing capacity even if their content is exclusively \u201cobjective,\u201d concerned with the matters of the world of things in which men move, which physically lies between them and out of which arise their specific, objective, worldly interests.", " These interests constitute, in the word\u2019s most literal significance, something which inter-est, which lies between people and therefore can relate and bind them together.", " Most action and speech is concerned with this in-between, which varies with each group of people, so that most words and deeds are about some worldly objective reality in addition to being a disclosure of the acting and speaking agent.", " Since this disclosure of the subject is an integral part of all, even the most

are to trust Xenophon, Socrates likened his daimonion to the oracles and insisted that both should be used only for human affairs, where nothing is certain, and not for problems of the arts and crafts, where everything is predictable (ibid.", " 7-9).", " Action ests is overlaid and, as it were, overgrown with an altogether different in-between which consists of deeds and words and owes its origin exclusively to men\u2019s acting and speaking directly to one another.", " This second, subjective in-between is not tangible, since there are no tangible objects into which it could solidify; the process of acting and speaking can leave behind no such results and end products.", " But for all its intangibility, this in-between is no less real than the world of things we visibly have in common.", " We call this reality the \u201cweb\u201d of human relationships, indicating by the metaphor its somewhat intangible quality.", " To be sure, this web is no less bound to the objective world of things than speech is to the existence of a living body, but the relationship is not like that of a fagade or, in Marxian terminology, of an essentially superfluous superstructure affixed to the useful structure of the building itself.", " The basic error of all materialism in politics \u2014 and this materialism is not Marxian and not even modern in origin, but as old as our history of political theory 8 \u2014 is to overlook the inevitability with which men disclose themselves as subjects, as distinct and unique persons, even when they wholly concentrate upon reaching an altogether worldly, material object.", " To dispense with this disclosure, if indeed it could ever be done, would mean to transform men into something they are not; to deny, on the other hand, that this

those with whom he comes into contact.", " It is because of this already existing web of human relationships, with its innumerable, conflicting wills and intentions, that action almost never achieves its purpose; but it is also because of this medium, in which action alone is real, that it \u201cproduces\u201d stories with or without intention as naturally as fabrication produces tangible things.", " These stories may then be recorded in documents and monuments, they may be visible in use objects or art works, they may be told and retold and worked into all kinds of material.", " They

and death can eventually be told as a story with beginning and end is the prepolitical and prehistorical condition of history, the great story without beginning and end.", " But the reason why each human life tells its story and why history ultimately becomes the storybook of mankind, with many actors and speakers and yet without any tangible authors, is that both are the outcome of action.", " For the great unknown in history, that has baffled the philosophy of history in the modern age, arises not only when one considers history as a whole and finds that its subject, mankind, is an abstraction which never can become an active agent; the same unknown has baffled Action political philosophy from its beginning in antiquity and contributed to the general contempt in which philosophers since Plato have held the realm of human affairs.", " The perplexity is that in any series of events that together form a story with a unique meaning we can at best isolate the agent who set the whole process into motion; and although this agent frequently remains the subject, the \u201chero\u201d of the story, we never can point unequivocally to him as the author of its eventual outcome.", " It is for this reason that Plato thought that human affairs (ta ton anthropon pragmata ) , the outcome of action (praxis ) , should not be treated with great seriousness; the actions of men appear like the gestures of puppets led by an invisible hand behind the scene, so that man seems to be a kind of plaything of a god .", " 9 It is noteworthy that Plato, who had no inkling of the modern concept of history, should have been the first to invent the metaphor of an actor behind the scenes who, behind the backs of acting men, pulls the strings and is responsible for the story.", " The Platonic god is but a symbol for the fact that real stories, in distinction from those we invent, have no author; as such, he is the true forerunner of Providence, the \u201cinvisible hand,\u201d Nature, the \u2018 world spirit, class interest, and the like, with which Christian and modern philosophers of history tried to solve the perplexing problem that although history owes its existence to

and forces or ideas \u2014 than the introduction of an invisible actor behind the scenes whom we find in all philosophies of history, which for this reason alone can be recognized as political philosophies in disguise.", " By the same token, the simple fact that Adam Smith needed an \u201cinvisible hand\u201d to guide economic dealings on the exchange market shows plainly that more than sheer economic activity is involved in exchange and that economic man,\u201d when he makes his appearance on the market, is an acting being and neither exclusively a producer nor a trader and

line and left no work behind, than of Plato or Aristotle, we know much better and more intimately who he was, because we know his story, than we know who Aristotle was, about whose opinions we are so much better informed.", " The hero the story discloses needs no heroic qualities; the word \u201chero\u201d originally, that is, in Homer, was no more than a name given each free man who participated

forms of reification in art works which glorify a deed or an accomplishment and, by transformation and condensation, show some extraordinary event in its full significance.", " However, the specific revelatory quality of action and speech, the implicit manifestation of the agent and speaker, is so indissolubly tied to the living flux of acting and speaking that it can be represented and \u201creified\u201d only through a kind of repetition, the imitation or mimesis, which according to Aristotle prevails in all arts but is actually appropriate only to the drama , whose very name (from the Greek verb dran, \u201cto act\u201d) indicates that playacting actually is an imitation of acting .", " 11 But the imitative element lies not only in the art of the actor, but, as Aristotle rightly claims, in the making or writing of the play, at least to the extent that the drama comes fully to life only when it is enacted in the theater.", " Only the actors and speakers who re-enact the story\u2019s plot can convey the full meaning, not so much of the story itself, but of the \u201cheroes\u201d who reveal themselves in it .", " 12 In terms of Greek tragedy, this would mean that

awkward.", " 12.", " Aristotle therefore usually speaks not of an imitation of action ( praxis ) but of the agents (prattontes ) (see Poetics 1448al ff.", ", 1448b25, 1449b24fif.", ").", " He is not consistent, however, in this use (cf.", " 1451a29, 1447a28).", " The decisive point is that tragedy does not deal with the qualities of men, their poiotes, but with whatever happened with respect to them, with their actions and life and good or ill fortune (1450al 5-18).", " The content of tragedy, therefore, is not what we would call character but action or the plot.", " 13.", " That the chorus

men.", " His failure is frequently blamed upon the fatal inferiority of the many and the resentment every outstanding person inspires in those who are mediocre.", " Yet true as such observations are bound to be, they do not touch the heart of the matter.", " In order to illustrate what is at stake here we may remember that Greek and Latin, unlike the modern languages, contain two altogether different and yet interrelated words with which to designate the verb \u201cto act.", "\u201d To the two Greek verbs archein (\u201cto begin,\u201d \u201cto lead,\u201d finally \u201cto rule\u201d) and pattern (\u201cto pass through,\u201d \u201cto achieve,\u201d \u201cto finish\u201d) correspond the two Latin verbs agere (\u201cto set into motion,\u201d \u201cto lead\u201d) and genre (whose original meaning is \u201cto bear \u201d).", " 16 Here it seems as though each action were divided into two parts, the beginning made by a single person and the achievement in which many join by bearing\u201d and \u201cfinishing\u201d the enterprise, by seeing it through.", " Not only are the words interrelated in a similar manner, the history of their usage is very similar too.", " In both cases the word that originally designated only the second part of action, its achievement \u2014 pattern and gerere \u2014 became the accepted word for action in general, whereas the words designating the beginning of action became specialized in meaning, at least in political language.", " Archein came to mean chiefly \u201cto rule\u201d and \u201cto lead\u201d when it was specifically used, and agere came to mean \u201cto lead\u201d rather than \u201cto set into motion.", "\u201d Thus the role of the beginner and leader, who was a primus inter pares (in the case of Homer, a king among kings) , changed into that of a ruler; the original interdependence of action, the dependence of the beginner and leader upon others for help and the dependence of his followers upon him for an occasion to act themselves, split into two altogether different functions: the function of giving commands, which became the prerogative of the ruler, and the function of executing them, which became the duty of his subjects.", " This ruler is alone, isolated against others by his force, just as the beginner was isolated through his initiative at 16.", " For archeiti and prattein see especially their use in Homer (cf.", " C.", " Capelle, Wbrterbuch des Homeros und der Homeriden [1889]).", " the start, before he had found others to join him.", " Yet the strength of the beginner and leader shows itself only in his initiative and the risk he takes, not in the actual achievement.", " In the case of the successful ruler, he may claim for himself what actually is the achievement of many \u2014 something that Agamemnon, who was a king but no ruler, would never have been permitted.", " Through this claim, the ruler monopolizes, so to speak, the strength of those without whose help he would never be able to achieve anything.", " Thus, the delusion of extraordinary strength arises and with it the fallacy of the strong man who is powerful because he is alone.", " Because the actor always moves among and in relation to other acting beings, he is never merely a \u201cdoer\u201d but always and at the same time a sufferer.", " To do and to suffer are like opposite sides of the same coin, and the story that an act starts is composed of its consequent deeds and sufferings.", " These consequences are boundless, because action, though it may proceed from nowhere, so to speak, acts into a medium where every reaction becomes a chain reaction and where every process is the cause of new processes.", " Since action acts upon beings who are capable of their own actions, reaction, apart from being a response, is always a new action that strikes out on its own and affects others.", " Thus action and reaction among men never move in a closed circle and can never be reliably confined to two partners.", " This boundlessness is characteristic not of political action alone, in the narrower sense of the word, as though the boundlessness of human interrelatedness were only the result of the boundless multitude of people involved, which could be escaped by resigning oneself to action within a limited, graspable framework of circumstances; the smallest act in the most limited circumstances bears the seed of the same boundlessness, because one deed, and sometimes one word, suffices to change every constellation.", " Action, moreover, no matter what its specific content, always establishes relationships and therefore has an inherent tendency to force open all limitations and cut across all boundaries .", " 17 Limita17.", " It is interesting to note that Montesquieu, whose concern was not with laws but with the actions their spirit would inspire, defines laws as rapports subAction tions and boundaries exist within the realm of human affairs, but they never offer a framework that can reliably withstand the onslaught with which each new generation must insert itself.", " The frailty of human institutions and laws and, generally, of all matters pertaining to men\u2019s living together, arises from the human condition of natality and is quite independent of the frailty of human nature.", " The fences inclosing private property and insuring the limitations of each household, the territorial boundaries which protect and make possible the physical identity of a people, and the laws which protect and make possible its political existence, are of such great importance to the stability of human affairs precisely because no such limiting and protecting principles rise out of the activities going on in the realm of human affairs itself.", " The limitations of the law are never entirely reliable safeguards against action from within the body politic, just as the boundaries of the territory are never entirely reliable safeguards against action from without.", " The boundlessness of action is only the other side of its tremendous capacity for establishing relationships, that is, its specific productivity; this is why the old virtue of moderation, of keeping within bounds, is indeed one of the political virtues par excellence, just as the political temptation par excellence is indeed hubris (as the Greeks, fully experienced in the potentialities of action, knew so well) and not the will to power, as we are inclined to believe.", " Yet while the various limitations and boundaries we find in every body politic may offer some protection against the inherent boundlessness of action, they are altogether helpless to offset its second outstanding character: its inherent unpredictability.", " This is not simply a question of inability to foretell all the logical consequences of a particular act, in which case an electronic computer would be able to foretell the future, but arises directly out of the story which, as the result of action, begins and establishes sisting between different beings {Esprit des lots, Book I, ch.", " 1; cf.", " Book XXVI, ch.", " 1) .", " This definition is surprising because laws had always been defined in terms of boundaries and limitations.", " The reason for it is that Montesquieu was less interested in what he called the \u201cnature of government\u201d \u2014 whether it was a republic or a monarchy, for instance \u2014 than in its \u201cprinciple .", " by which it is made to act, .", " the human passions which set it in motion\u201d (Book III, ch.", " 1).", " itself as soon as the fleeting moment of the deed is past.", " The trouble is that whatever the character and content of the subsequent story may be, whether it is played in private or public life, whether it involves many or few actors, its full meaning can reveal itself only when it has ended.", " In contradistinction to fabrication, where the light by which to judge the finished product is provided by the image or model perceived beforehand by the craftsman\u2019s eye, the light that illuminates processes of action, and therefore all historical processes, appears only at their end, frequently when all the participants are dead.", " Action reveals itself fully only to the storyteller, that is, to the backward glance of the historian, who indeed always knows better what it was all about than the participants.", " All accounts told by the actors themselves, though they may in rare cases give an entirely trustworthy statement of intentions, aims, and motives, become mere useful source material in the historian\u2019s hands and can never match his story in significance and truthfulness.", " What the storyteller narrates must necessarily be hidden from the actor himself, at least as long as he is in the act or caught in its consequences, because to him the meaningfulness of his act is not in the story that follows.", " Even though stories are the inevitable results of action, it is not the actor but the storyteller who perceives and \u201cmakes\u201d the story.", " 27 THE GREEK SOLUTION This unpredictability of outcome is closely related to the revelatory character of action and speech, in which one discloses one\u2019s self without ever either knowing himself or being able to calculate beforehand whom he reveals.", " The ancient saying that nobody can be called eudaimm before he is dead may point to the issue at stake, if we could hear its original meaning after two and a half thousand years of hackneyed repetition; not even its Latin translation, proverbial and trite already in Rome \u2014 nemo ante mortem beatus esse diet potest \u2014 conveys this meaning, although it may have inspired the practice of the Catholic Church to beatify her saints only after they have long been safely dead.", " For eudaimonia means neither happiness nor beatitude; it cannot be translated and perAction haps cannot even be explained.", " It has the connotation of blessedness, but without any religious overtones, and it means literally something like the well-being of the daimdn who accompanies each man throughout life, who is his distinct identity, but appears and is visible only to others .", " 18 Unlike happiness, therefore, which is a passing mood, and unlike good fortune, which one may have at certain periods of life and lack in others, eudaimonia , like life itself, is a lasting state of being which is neither subject to change nor capable of effecting change.", " To be eudaimon and to have been eudaimon, according to Aristotle, are the same, just as to \u201clive well\u201d (eu dzen) and to have \u201clived well\u201d are the same as long as life lasts; they are not states or activities which change a person\u2019s quality, such as learning and having learned, which indicate two altogether different attributes of the same person at different moments .", " 19 This unchangeable identity of the person, though disclosing itself intangibly in act and speech, becomes tangible only in the story of the actor\u2019s and speaker\u2019s life; but as such it can be known, that is, grasped as a palpable entity only after it has come to its end.", " In other words, human essence \u2014 no't human nature in general (which does not exist) nor the sum total of qualities and shortcomings in the individual, but the essence of who somebody is \u2014 can come into being only when life departs, leaving behind nothing but a story.", " Therefore whoever consciously aims at being \u201cessential,\u201d at leaving behind a story and an identity which will win \u201cimmortal fame,\u201d must not only risk his life but expressly choose, as Achilles did, a short life and premature death.", " Only a man who does not survive his one

1048b23 ff.", " tinuation of what he began.", " What gives the story of Achilles its paradigmatic significance is that it shows in a nutshell that eudaimonia can be bought only at the price of life and that one can make sure of it only by foregoing the continuity of living in which we disclose ourselves piecemeal, by summing up all of one\u2019s life in a single deed, so that the story of the act comes to its end together with life itself.", " Even Achilles, it is true, remains dependent upon the storyteller, poet, or historian, without whom everything he did remains futile; but he is the only \u201chero,\u201d and therefore the hero par excellence, who delivers into the narrator\u2019s hands the full significance of his deed, so that it is as though he had not merely enacted the story of his life but at the same time also \u201cmade\u201d it.", " No doubt this concept of action is highly individualistic, as we would say today .", " 20 It stresses the urge toward self-disclosure at the expense of all other factors and therefore remains relatively untouched by the predicament of unpredictability.", " As such it became the prototype of action for Greek antiquity and influenced, in the form of the so-called agonal spirit, the passionate drive to show one\u2019s self in measuring up against others that underlies the concept of politics prevalent in the city-states.", " An outstanding symptom of this prevailing influence is that the Greeks, in distinction from all later developments, did not count legislating among the political activities.", " In their opinion, the lawmaker was like the builder of the city wall, someone who had to do and finish his work before political activity could begin.", " He therefore was treated like any other craftsman or architect and could be called from abroad and commissioned without having to be a citizen, whereas the right to politeuesthai , to engage in the numerous activities which eventually went on in the polis, was entirely restricted to citizens.", " To them, the laws, like the wall around the city, were not results of action but products of making.", " Before men began to act, a definite space had to be secured and a structure built where all subsequent actions could take place, the space 20.", " The fact that the Greek word for \u201cevery one\u201d ( hekastos ) is derived from hekas (\u201cfar off\u201d) seems to indicate how deep-rooted this \u201cindividualism\u201d must have been.", " Action being the public realm of the polls and its structure the law; legislator and architect belonged in the same category .", " 21 But these tangible entities themselves were not the content of politics (not Athens, but the Athenians, were the polls 22 ), and they did not command the same loyalty we know from the Roman type of patriotism.", " Though it is true that Plato and Aristotle elevated lawmaking and city-building to the highest rank in political life, this does not indicate that they enlarged the fundamental Greek experiences of action and politics to comprehend what later turned out to be the political genius of Rome: legislation and foundation.", " The Socratic school, on the contrary, turned to these activities, which to the Greeks were prepolitical, because they wished to turn against politics and against action.", " To them, legislating and the execution of decisions by vote are the most legitimate political activities because in them men \u201cact like craftsmen\u201d: the result of their action is a tangible product, and its process has a clearly recognizable end .", " 23 This is no longer or, rather, not yet action (praxis), properly speaking, but making (poiesis ), which they prefer because of its greater reliability.", " It is as though they had said that if men only renounce their capacity for action, with its futility, boundlessness, and uncertainty of outcome, there could be a remedy for the frailty of human affairs.", " How this remedy can destroy the very substance of human relationships is perhaps best illustrated in one of the rare instances 21.", " See, for instance, Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics 1141b25.", " There is no more elemental difference between Greece and Rome than their respective attitudes toward territory and law.", " In Rome, the foundation of the city and the establishment of its laws remained the great and decisive act to which all later deeds and accomplishments had to be related in order to acquire political validity and legitimation.", " 22.", " See M.", " F.", " Schachermeyr, \u201cLa formation de la cite

territory of the city of Babylon.", " 23 .", " \u201cFor [the legislators] alone act like craftsmen [ cheirotechnoi ] \u201d because their act has a tangible end, an eschaton, which is the decree passed in the assembly ( psephisma ) ( Nicomachean Ethics 1141b29).", " where Aristotle draws an example of acting from the sphere of private life, in the relationship between the benefactor and his recipient.", " With that candid absence of moralizing that is the mark of Greek, though not of Roman, antiquity, he states first as a matter of fact that the benefactor always loves those he has helped more than he is loved by them.", " He then goes on to explain that this is only natural, since the benefactor has done a work, an ergon, while the recipient has only endured his beneficence.", " The benefactor, according to Aristotle, loves his \u201cwork,\u201d the life of the recipient which he has \u201cmade,\u201d as the poet loves his poems, and he reminds his readers that the poet\u2019s love for his work is hardly less passionate than a mother\u2019s love for her children .", " 24 This explanation shows clearly that he thinks of acting in terms of making, and of its result, the relationship between men, in terms of an accomplished \u201cwork\u201d (his emphatic attempts to distinguish between action and fabrication, praxis and poiesis, notwithstanding) .", " 26 In this instance, it is perfectly obvious how this interpretation, though it may serve to explain psychologically the phenomenon of ingratitude on the assumption that both benefactor and recipient agree about an interpretation of action in terms of making, actually spoils the action itself and its true result, the relationship it should have established.", " The example of the legislator is less plausible for us only because the Greek notion of the task and role of the legislator in the public realm is so utterly alien to our own.", " In any event, work, such as the activity of the legislator in Greek understanding, can become the content of action only on condition that further action is not desirable or possible; and action can result in an end product only on condition that its own authentic, non-tangible, and always utterly fragile meaning is destroyed.", " The original, prephilosophic Greek remedy for this frailty had been the foundation of the polis.", " The polls, as

otherwise had been possible only as an extraordinary and infrequent enterprise for which they had to leave their households.", " The polls was supposed to multiply the occasions to win \u201cimmortal fame,\u201d that is, to multiply the chances for everybody to distinguish himself, to show in deed and word who he was in his unique distinctness.", " One, if not the chief, reason for the incredible development of gift and genius in Athens, as well as for the hardly less surprising swift decline of the city-state, was precisely that from beginning to end its foremost aim was to make the extraordinary an ordinary occurrence of everyday life.", " The second function of the polls, again closely connected with the hazards of action as experienced before its coming into being, was to offer a remedy for the futility of action and speech; for the chances that a deed deserving fame would not be forgotten, that it actually would become \u201cimmortal,\u201d were not very good.", " Florner was not only a shining example of the poet\u2019s political function, and therefore the \u201ceducator of all Hellas\u201d; the very fact that so great an enterprise as the Trojan War could have been forgotten without a poet to immortalize it several hundred years later offered only too good an example of what could happen to human greatness if it had nothing but poets to rely on for its permanence.", " We are not concerned here with the historical causes for the rise of the Greek city-state; what the Greeks themselves thought of it and its raison d'etre , they have made unmistakably clear.", " The polls \u2014 if we trust the famous words of Pericles in the Funeral Oration \u2014 gives a guaranty that those who forced every sea and land to become the scene of their daring will not remain without witness and will need neither Homer nor anyone else who knows how to turn words to praise them; without assistance from others, those who acted will be able to establish together the everlasting remembrance of their good and bad deeds, to inspire admiration in the present and in future ages .", " 27 In other words, men\u2019s life together in the form of the polls seemed to

assures the mortal actor that his passing existence and fleeting greatness will never lack the reality that comes from being seen, being heard, and, generally, appearing before an audience of fellow men, who outside the polis could attend only the short duration of the performance and therefore needed Homer and \u201cothers of his craft\u201d in order to be presented to those who were not there.", " According to this self-interpretation, the political realm rises directly out of acting together, the \u201csharing of words and deeds.", "\u201d Thus action not only has the most intimate relationship to the public part of the world common to us all, but is the one activity which constitutes it.", " It is as though the wall of the polls and the boundaries of the law were drawn around an already existing public space which, however, without such stabilizing protection could not endure, could not survive the moment of action and speech itself.", " Not historically, of course, but speaking metaphorically and theoretically, it is as though the men who returned from the Trojan War had wished to make permanent the space of action which had arisen from their deeds and sufferings, to prevent its perishing with their dispersal and return to their isolated homesteads.", " The polis, properly speaking, is not the city-state in its physical location; it is the organization of the people as it arises out of acting and speaking together, and its true space lies between people living together for this purpose, no matter where they happen to be.", " \u201cWherever you go, you will be a polis\u201d: these famous words became not merely the watchword of Greek colonization, they expressed the conviction that action and speech create a space between the participants which can find its proper location almost any time and anywhere.", " It is the space of appearance in the widest sense of the word, namely, the space where I appear to others as others appear to me, where men exist not Action merely like other living or inanimate things but make their appearance explicitly.", " This space does not always exist, and although all men are capable of deed and word, most of them\u2014 like the slave, the foreigner, and the barbarian in antiquity, like the laborer or craftsman prior to the modern age, the jobholder or businessman in our world \u2014 do not live in it.", " No man, moreover, can live in it all the time.", " To be deprived of it means to be deprived of reality, which, humanly and politically speaking, is the same as appearance.", " To men the reality of

organized.", " Its peculiarity is that, unlike the spaces which are the work of our hands, it does not survive the actuality of the movement which brought it into being, but disappears not only with

remark just quoted.", " less visible internal decay that invites disaster \u2014 is due to this peculiarity of the public realm, which, because it ultimately resides on action and speech, never altogether loses its potential character.", " What first undermines and then kills political communities is loss of power and final impotence; and power cannot be stored up and kept in reserve for emergencies, like the instruments of violence, but exists only in its actualization.", " Where power is not actualized, it passes away, and history is full of examples that the greatest material riches cannot compensate for this loss.", " Power is actualized only where word and deed have not parted company, where words are not empty and deeds not brutal, where words are not used to veil intentions but to disclose realities, and deeds are not used to violate and destroy but to establish relations and create new realities.", " Power is what keeps the public realm, the potential space of appearance between acting and speaking men, in existence.", " The word itself, its Greek equivalent dynamis , like the Latin potentia with its various modern dervatives or the German Macht (which derives from mogen and moglich , not from macheri), indicates its \u201cpotential\u201d character.", " Power is always, as we would say, a power potential and not an unchangeable, measurable, and reliable entity like force or strength.", " While strength is the natural quality of an individual seen in isolation, power springs up between men when they act together and vanishes the moment they disperse.", " Because of this peculiarity, which power shares with all potentialities that can only be actualized but never fully materialized, power is to an astonishing degree independent of material factors, either of numbers or means.", " A comparatively small but well-organized group of men can rule almost indefinitely over large and populous empires, and it is not infrequent in history that small and poor countries get the better of great and rich nations.", " (The story of David and Goliath is only metaphorically true; the power of a few can be greater than the power of many, but in a contest between two men not power but strength decides, and cleverness, that is, brain power, contributes materially to the outcome on the same level as muscular force.", ") Popular revolt against materially strong rulers, on the other hand, may engender an almost irresistible power even if it foregoes the use of violence in the face of Action materially vastly superior forces.", " To call this \u201cpassive resistance\u201d is certainly an ironic idea; it is one of the most active and efficient ways of action ever devised, because it cannot be countered by fighting, where there may be defeat or victory, but only by mass slaughter in which even the victor is defeated, cheated of his prize, since nobody can rule over dead men.", " The only indispensable material factor in the generation of power is the living together of people.", " Only where men live so close together that the potentialities of action are always present can power remain with them, and the foundation of cities, which as city-states have remained paradigmatic for all Western political organization, is therefore indeed the most important material prerequisite for power.", " What keeps people together after the fleeting moment of action has passed (what we today call \u201corganization\u201d) and what, at the same time, they keep alive through remaining together is power.", " And whoever, for whatever reasons, isolates himself and does not partake in such being together, forfeits power and becomes impotent, no matter how great his strength and how valid his reasons.", " If power were more than this potentiality in being together, if it could be possessed like strength or applied like force instead of being dependent upon the unreliable and only temporary agreement of many wills and intentions, omnipotence would be a concrete human possibility.", " For power, like action, is boundless; it has no physical limitation in human nature, in the bodily existence of man, like strength.", " Its only limitation is the existence of other people, but this limitation is not accidental, because human power corresponds to the condition of plurality to begin with.", " For the same reason, power can be divided without decreasing it, and the interplay of powers with their checks and balances is even liable to generate more power, so long, at least, as the interplay is alive and has not resulted in a stalemate.", " Strength, on the contrary, is indivisible, and while it, too, is checked and balanced by the presence of others, the interplay of plurality in this case spells a definite limitation on the strength of the individual, which is kept in bounds and may be overpowered by the power potential of the many.", " An identification of the strength necessary for the production of things with the power necessary for action is conceivable only as the divine attribute of one god.", " Omnipotence therefore is never an attribute of gods in polytheism, no matter how superior the strength of the gods may be to the forces of men.", " Conversely, aspiration toward omnipotence always implies\u2014 apart from its utopian hubris \u2014 the destruction of plurality.", " Under the conditions of human life, the only alternative to power is not strength\u2014 which is helpless against power \u2014 but force, which indeed one man alone can exert against his fellow men and of which one or a few can possess a monopoly by acquiring the means of violence.", " But while violence can destroy power, it can never become a substitute for it.", " From this results the by no means infrequent political combination of force and powerlessness, an array of impotent forces that spend themselves, often spectacularly and vehemently but in utter futility, leaving behind neither monuments nor stories, hardly enough memory to enter into history at all.", " In historical experience and traditional theory, this combination, even if it is not recognized as such, is known as tyranny, and the time-honored fear of this form of government is not exclusively inspired by its cruelty, which\u2014 as the long series of benevolent tyrants and enlightened despots attests \u2014 is not among its inevitable features, but by the impotence and futility to which it condemns the rulers as well as the ruled.", " More important is a discovery made, as far as I know, only by Montesquieu, the last political thinker to concern himself seriously with the problem of forms of government.", " Montesquieu realized that the outstanding characteristic of tyranny was that it rested on isolation \u2014 on the isolation of the tyrant from his subjects and the isolation of the subjects from each other through mutual fear and suspicion \u2014 and hence that tyranny was not one form of government among others but contradicted the essential human condition of plurality, the acting and speaking together, which is the condition of all forms of political organization.", " Tyranny prevents the development of power, not only in a particular segment of the public realm but in its entirety; it generates, in other words, impotence as naturally as other bodies politic generate power.", " This, in Montesquieu\u2019s interpretation, makes it necessary to assign it a special position in the theory of political bodies: it alone is unable to develop enough power to remain at all in the space of appearAction ance, the public realm; on the contrary, it develops the germs of its own destruction the moment it comes into existence .", " 30 Violence, curiously enough, can destroy power more easily than it can destroy strength, and while a tyranny is always characterized by the impotence of its subjects, who have lost their human capacity to act and speak together, it is not necessarily characterized by weakness and sterility; on the contrary, the crafts and arts may flourish under these conditions if the ruler is \u201cbenevolent\u201d enough to leave his subjects alone in their isolation.", " Strength, on the other hand, nature\u2019s gift to the individual which cannot be shared with others, can cope with violence more successfully than with power \u2014 either heroically, by consenting to fight and die, or stoically, by accepting suffering and challenging all affliction through self-sufficiency and withdrawal from the world; in either case, the integrity of the individual and his strength remain intact.", " Strength can actually be ruined only by power and is therefore always in danger from the combined force of the many.", " Power corrupts indeed when the weak band together in order to ruin the strong, but not before.", " The will to power, as the modem age from Hobbes to Nietzsche understood it in glorification or denunciation, far from being a characteristic of the strong, is, like envy and greed, among the vices of the weak, and possibly even their most dangerous one.", " If tyranny can be described as the always abortive attempt to substitute violence for power, ochlocracy, or mob rule, which is its exact counterpart, can be characterized by the much more promising attempt to substitute power for strength.", " Power indeed can ruin all strength and we know that where the main public realm is society, there is always the danger that, through a perverted form of \u201cacting together\u201d \u2014 by pull and pressure and the tricks of cliques\u2014 those are brought to the fore who know nothing and can do nothing.", " The vehement yearning for violence, so char30.", " In the words of Montesquieu, who ignores the difference between tyranny and despotism: \u201cLe principe du gouvemement despotique se corrompt sans cesse, parcequ\u2019il est corrompu par sa nature.", " Les autres gouvernements perissent, parceque des accidents particuliers en violent le principe: celui-ci perit par son vice interieur, lorsque quelques causes accidentelles n\u2019empechent point son principe de se corrompre\u201d

of their strength .", " 31 Power preserves the public realm and the space of appearance, and as such it is also the lifeblood of the human artifice, which, unless it is the scene of action and speech, of the web of human affairs and relationships and the stories engendered by them, lacks its ultimate raison d'etre.", " Without being talked about by men and without housing them, the world would not be a human artifice but a heap of unrelated things to which each isolated individual was at liberty to add one more object; without the human artifice to house them, human affairs would be as floating, as futile and vain, as the wanderings of nomad tribes.", " The melancholy wisdom of Ecclesiastes \u2014 \u201cVanity of vanities; all is vanity.", " .", " .", " .", " There is no new thing

gone.", " Without action to bring into the play of the world the new beginning of which each man is capable by virtue of being born, \u201cthere is no new thing under the sun\u201d; without speech to materialize and memorialize, however tentatively, the \u201cnew things\u201d that appear and shine forth, \u201cthere is no remembrance\u201d; without the enduring permanence of a human artifact, there cannot \u201cbe any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.", "\u201d And without power, the space of appearance brought forth through action and speech in public will fade away as rapidly as the living deed and the living word.", " Perhaps nothing in our history has been so short-lived as trust in power, nothing more lasting than the Platonic and Christian distrust of the splendor attending its space of appearance, nothing 31.", " The extent to which Nietzsche\u2019s glorification of the will to power was inspired by such experiences of the modern intellectual may be surmised from the following side remark: \u201cDenn die Ohnmacht gegen Menschen, nicht die Ohnmacht gegen die Natur, erzeugt die desperateste Verbitterung gegen das Dasein\u201d (Wille zur Macht, No.", " 55).", " Action \u2014 finally in the modern age\u2014 more common than the conviction that \u201cpower corrupts.", "\u201d The words of Pericles, as Thucydides reports them, are perhaps unique in their supreme confidence that men can enact and save their greatness at the same time and, as it were, by one and the same gesture, and that the performance as such will be enough to generate dynamis and not need the transforming reification of homo faber to keep it in reality .", " 32 Pericles\u2019 speech, though it certainly corresponded to and articulated the innermost convictions of the people of Athens, has always been read with the sad wisdom of hindsight by men who knew that his words were spoken at the beginning of the end.", " Yet short-lived as this faith in dynamis (and consequently in politics) may have been \u2014 and it had already come to an end when the first political philosophies were formulated \u2014 its bare existence has sufficed to elevate action to the highest rank in the hierarchy of the vita activa and to single out speech as the decisive distinction between human and animal life, both of which bestowed upon politics a dignity which even today has not altogether disappeared.", " What is outstandingly clear in Pericles\u2019 formulations \u2014 and, incidentally, no less transparent in Homer\u2019s poems \u2014 is that the innermost meaning of the acted deed and the spoken word is independent of victory and defeat and must remain untouched by any eventual outcome, by their consequences for better or worse.", " Unlike human behavior \u2014 which the Greeks, like all civilized people, judged according to \u201cmoral standards,\u201d taking into account motives and intentions on the one hand and aims and consequences on the other\u2014 action can be judged only by the criterion of greatness because it is in its nature to break through the commonly accepted and reach into the extraordinary, where whatever is true in common and everyday life no longer applies because everything that exists is unique and sui generis .", " 33 Thucydides, or 32.", " In the above-mentioned paragraph in the Funeral Oration (n.", " 27) Pericles deliberately contrasts the dynamis of th tpolis with the craftsmanship of the poets.", " 3 3 .", " The reason why Aristotle in his Poetics finds that greatness ( megethos ) is a prerequisite of the dramatic plot is that the drama imitates acting and acting is judged by greatness, by its distinction from the commonplace (1450b25).", " The same, incidentally, is true for the beautiful, which resides in greatness and taxis, the joining together of the parts (1450b34 ff.", ") .", " Pericles, knew full well that he had broken with the normal standards for everyday behavior when he found the glory of Athens in having left behind \u201ceverywhere everlasting remembrance [mnemeia aidia ] of their good and their evil deeds.", "\u201d The art of politics teaches men how to bring forth what is great and radiant \u2014 ta megala kai lampra , in the words of Democritus; as long as the polls is there to inspire men to dare the extraordinary, all things are safe; if it perishes, everything is lost .", " 34 Motives and aims, no matter how pure or how grandiose, are never unique; like psychological qualities, they are typical, characteristic of different types of persons.", " Greatness, therefore, or the specific meaning of each deed, can lie only in the performance itself and neither in its motivation nor its achievement.", " It is this insistence on the living deed and the spoken word as the greatest achievements of which human beings are capable that was conceptualized in Aristotle\u2019s notion of energeia (\u201cactuality\u201d), with which he designated all activities that do not pursue an end (are ateleis) and leave no work behind (no par autas erga ), but exhaust their full meaning in the performance itself .", " 35 It is from the experience of this full actuality that the paradoxical \u201cend in itself\u201d derives its original meaning; for in thdse instances of action and speech 36 the end (telos) is not pursued but lies in the activity itself which therefore becomes an entelecheia , and the work is not what follows and extinguishes the process but is imbedded in it; the performance is the work, is energeia .", " 87 Aristotle, in his political philosophy, is still well aware of what is at stake in politics, namely, no less than the ergon ton anthropou 38 (the \u201cwork of man\u201d qua 34.", " See fragment B157

seeing and flute-playing.", " 36.", " It is of no importance in our context that Aristotle saw the highest possibility of \u201cactuality\u201d not in action and speech, but in contemplation and thought, in theoria and nous.", " 37.", " The two Aristotelian concepts, energeia and entelecheia , are closely interrelated ( energeia .", " .", " .", " synteinei pros ten entelecheian) : full actuality ( energeia ) effects and produces nothing besides itself, and full reality ( entelecheia ) has no other end besides itself (see Metaphysics 1050a22-35).", " 38.", " Nicomachean Ethics 1097b22.", " Action man), and if he defined this \u201cwork\u201d as \u201cto live well\u201d (eu zeri), he clearly meant that \u201cwork\u201d here is no work product but exists only in sheer actuality.", " This specifically human achievement lies altogether outside the category of means and ends; the \u201cwork of man\u201d is no end because the means to achieve it \u2014 the virtues, or aretai \u2014 are not qualities which may or may not be actualized, but are themselves \u201cactualities.", "\u201d In other words, the means to achieve the end would already be the end; and this \u201cend,\u201d conversely, cannot be considered a means in some other respect, because there is nothing higher to attain than this actuality itself.", " It is like a feeble echo of the prephilosophical Greek experience of action and speech as sheer actuality to read time and again in political philosophy since Democritus and Plato that politics is a techne, belongs among the arts, and can be likened to such activities as healing or navigation, where, as in the performance of the dancer or play-actor, the \u201cproduct\u201d is identical with the performing act itself.", " But we may gauge what has happened to action and speech, which are only in actuality, and therefore the highest activities in the political realm, when we hear what modern society, with the peculiar and uncompromising consistency that characterized it in its early stages, had to say about them.", " For this allimportant degradation of action and speech is implied when Adam Smith classifies all occupations which rest essentially on performance \u2014 such as the military profession, \u201cchurchmen, lawyers, physicians and opera-singers\u201d \u2014 together with \u201cmenial services,\u201d the lowest and most unproductive \u201clabour .", "\u201d 39 It was precisely these occupations \u2014 healing, flute-playing, play-acting \u2014 which furnished ancient thinking with examples for the highest and greatest activities of man.", " 29 Homo Faber and the space OF APPEARANCE The root of the ancient estimation of politics is the conviction that man qua man, each individual in his unique distinctness, appears and confirms himself in speech and action, and that these activi39.", " Wealth of Nations (Everyman\u2019s ed.", "), II, 295.", " ties, despite their material futility, possess an enduring quality of their own because they create their own remembrance .", " 40 The public realm, the space within the world which men need in order to appear at all, is therefore more specifically \u201cthe work of man\u201d than is the work of his hands or the labor of his body.", " The conviction that the greatest that man can achieve is his own appearance and actualization is by no means a matter of course.", " Against it stands the conviction of homo faber that a man\u2019s products may be more\u2014 and not only more lasting\u2014 than he is himself, as well as the animal laborans' firm belief that life is the highest of all goods.", " Both, therefore, are, strictly speaking, unpolitical, and will incline to denounce action and speech as idleness, idle busybodyness and idle talk, and generally will judge public activities in terms of their usefulness to supposedly higher ends\u2014 to make the world more useful and more beautiful in the case of homo faber , to make life easier and longer in the case of the animal laborans.", " This, however, is not to say that they are free to dispense with a public realm altogether, for without a space of appearance and without trusting in action and speech as a mode of being together, neither the reality of one\u2019s self, of one\u2019s own identity, nor the reality of the surrounding world can be established beyond doubt.", " The human sense of reality demands that men actualize the sheer passive givenness of their being, not in order to change it but in order to make articulate and call into full existence what otherwise they would have to suffer passively anyhow .", " 41 This actualization resides and comes to pass in those activities that exist only in sheer actuality.", " The only character of the world by which to gauge its reality is its being common to us all, and common sense occupies such a high rank in the hierarchy of political qualities because it is the one sense that fits into reality as a whole our five strictly individual senses and the strictly particular data they perceive.", " It is by virtue 40.", " This is a decisive feature of the Greek, though perhaps not of the Roman, concept of \u201cvirtue\u201d: where arete is, oblivion cannot occur (cf.", " Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics 1 1 00b 1 2\u2014 17).", " 41.", " This is the meaning of the last sentence of the Dante quotation at the head of this chapter; the sentence, though quite clear and simple in the Latin original, defies translation ( De nwmrchia i.", " 13).", " Action of common sense that the other sense perceptions are known to disclose reality and are not merely felt as irritations of our nerves or resistance sensations of our bodies.", " A noticeable decrease in common sense in any given community and a noticeable increase in superstition and gullibility are therefore almost infallible signs of alienation from the world.", " This alienation \u2014 the atrophy of the space of appearance and the withering of common sense \u2014 is, of course, carried to a much greater extreme in the case of a laboring society than in the case of a society of producers.", " In his isolation, not only undisturbed by others but also not seen and heard and confirmed by them, homo faber is together not only with the product he makes but also with the world of things to which he will add his own products; in this, albeit indirect, way, he is still together with others who made the world and who also are fabricators of things.", " We have already mentioned the exchange market on which the craftsmen meet their peers and which represents to them a common public realm in so far as each of them has contributed something to it.", " Yet while the public realm as exchange market corresponds most adequately to the activity of fabrication, exchange itself already belongs in the field of action and is by no means a mere prolongation of production; it is even less a mere function of automatic processes, as the buying of food and other means of consumption is necessarily incidental to laboring.", " Marx\u2019s contention that economic laws are like natural laws, that they are not made by man to regulate the free acts of exchange but are functions of the productive conditions of society as a whole, is correct only in a laboring society, where all activities are leveled down to the human body\u2019s metabolism with nature and where no exchange exists but only consumption.", " However, the people who meet on the exchange market are primarily not persons but producers of products, and what they show there is never themselves, not even their skills and qualities as in the \u201cconspicuous production\u201d of the Middle Ages, but their products.", " The impulse that drives the fabricator to the public market place is the desire for products, not for people, and the power that holds this market together and in existence is not the potentiality which springs up between people when they come together in action and speech, but a combined \u201cpower of exchange\u201d (Adam Smith) which each of the participants acquired in isolation.", " It is this lack of relatedness to others and this primary concern with exchangeable commodities which Marx denounced as the dehumanization and self-alienation of commercial society, which indeed excludes men qua men and demands, in striking reversal of the ancient relationship between private and public, that men show themselves only in the privacy of their families or the intimacy of their friends.", " The frustration of the human person inherent in a community of producers and even more in commercial society is perhaps best illustrated by the phenomenon of genius, in which, from the Renaissance to the end of the nineteenth century, the modern age saw its highest ideal.", " (Creative genius as the quintessential expression of human greatness was quite unknown to antiquity or the Middle Ages.", ") It is only with the beginning of our century that great artists in surprising unanimity have protested against being called \u201cgeniuses\u201d and have insisted on craftmanship, competence, and the close relationships between art and handicraft.", " This protest, to be sure, is partly no more than a reaction against the vulgarization and commercialization of the notion of genius; but it is also due to the more recent rise of a laboring society, for which productivity or creativity is no ideal and which lacks all experiences from which the very notion of greatness can spring.", " What is important in our context is that the work of genius, as distinguished from the product of the craftsman, appears to have absorbed those elements of distinctness and uniqueness which find their immediate expression only in action and speech.", " The modern age\u2019s obsession with the unique signature of each artist, its unprecedented sensitivity to style, shows a preoccupation with those features by which the artist transcends his skill and workmanship in a way similar to the way each person\u2019s uniqueness transcends the sum total of his qualities.", " Because of this

ceased to be a slave, and where, therefore, slavery remained the social condition of laboring no matter how many slaves were emancipated, the modern emancipation of labor was intended to elevate the laboring activity itself, and this was achieved long before the laborer as a person was granted personal and civil rights.", " However, one of the important side effects of the actual emanciwas:

if they know their business, may well be \u201ckindly and mild in everything,\u201d like Peisistratus, whose rule even in antiquity was compared to \u201cthe Golden Age of Cronos \u201d; 68 their

should beware, if only because they pave the way to an inevitable loss of power, even though the actual disaster may occur in a relatively distant future.", " Escape from the frailty of human affairs into the solidity of quiet and order has in fact so much to recommend it that the greater part of political philosophy since Plato could easily be interpreted as various attempts to find theoretical foundations and practical ways for an escape from politics altogether.", " The hallmark of all such escapes is the concept of rule, that is, the notion that men can lawfully and politically live together only when some are entitled to command and the others forced to obey.", " The commonplace notion already to be found in Plato and Aristotle that every political community consists of those who rule and those who are ruled (on which assumption in turn are based the current definitions of forms of government \u2014 rule by one or monarchy, rule by few or oligarchy, rule by many or democracy) rests on a suspicion of action rather than on a contempt for men, and arose from the earnest desire to find a substitute for action rather than from any irresponsible or tyrannical will to power.", " Theoretically, the most brief and most fundamental version of the escape from action into rule occurs in the Statesman, where Plato opens a gulf between the two modes of action, archein and prattein (\u201cbeginning\u201d and \u201cachieving\u201d), which according to Greek understanding were interconnected.", " The problem, as Plato saw it, was to make sure that the beginner would remain the complete master of what he had begun, not needing the help of others to carry it through.", " In the realm of action, this isolated mastership can be achieved only if the others are no longer needed to join the enterprise of their own accord, with their own motives and aims, but are used to execute orders, and if, on the other hand, the beginner who took the initiative does not permit himself to get involved in the action itself.", " To begin ( archein ) and to act (prattein ) thus can become two altogether different activities, and the beginAction ner has become a ruler (an archon in the twofold sense of the word) who \u201cdoes not have to act at all ( prattein ), but rules ( archein ) over those who are capable of execution.", "\u201d Under these circumstances, the essence of politics is \u201cto know how to begin and to rule in the gravest matters with regard to timeliness and untimeliness\u201d; action as such is entirely eliminated and has become the mere \u201cexecution of orders .", "\u201d 61 Plato was the first to introduce the division between those who know and do not act and those who act and do not know, instead of the old articulation of action into beginning and achieving, so that knowing what to do and doing it became two altogether different performances.", " Since Plato himself immediately identified the dividing line between thought and action with the gulf which separates the rulers from those over whom they rule, it is obvious that the experiences on which the Platonic division rests are those of the household, where nothing would ever be done if the master did not know what to do and did not give orders to the slaves who executed them without knowing.", " Here indeed, he who knows does not have to do and he who does needs no thought or knowledge.", " Plato was still quite aware that he proposed a revolutionary transformation of the polls when he applied to its administration the currently recognized maxims for a well-ordered household .", " 62 (It is a common error to interpret Plato as though he wanted to abolish the family and the household; he wanted, on the contrary, to extend this type of life until one family embraced every citizen.", " In other words, he wanted to eliminate from the household community its private character, and it is for this purpose that he recommended the abolition of private property and individual marital status .", ") 63 According to Greek understanding, the relationship between ruling and being ruled, 61.", " Statesman 305.", " 62.", " It is the decisive contention of the Statesman that no difference existed between the constitution of a large household and that of the polls (see 259), so that the same science would cover political and \u201ceconomic\u201d or household matters.", " 63.", " This is particularly manifest in those passages of the fifth book of the Republic in which Plato describes how the fear lest one attack his own son, brother, or father would further general peace in his utopian republic.", " Because of the community of women, nobody would know who his blood relatives were (see esp.", " 463C and 465B).", " between command and obedience, was by definition identical with the relationship between master and slaves and therefore precluded all possibility of action.", " Plato\u2019s contention, therefore, that the rules of behavior in public matters should be derived from the masterslave relationship in a well-ordered household actually meant that action should not play any part in human affairs.", " It is obvious that Plato\u2019s scheme offers much greater chances for a permanent order in human affairs than the tyrant\u2019s efforts to eliminate everybody but himself from the public realm.", " Although each citizen would retain some part in the handling of public affairs, they would indeed \u201cact\u201d like one man without even the possibility of internal dissension, let alone factional strife: through rule, \u201cthe many become one in every respect\u201d except bodily appearance .", " 64 Historically, the concept of rule, though originating in the household and family realm, has played its most decisive part in the organization of public matters and is for us invariably connected with politics.", " This should not make us overlook the fact that for Plato it was a much more general category.", " He saw in it the chief device for ordering and judging human affairs in every respect.", " This is not only evident from his insistence that the citystate must be considered to be \u201cman writ large\u201d and from his construction of a psychological order which actually follows the public order of his utopian city, but is even more manifest in the grandiose consistency with which he introduced the principle of domination into the intercourse of man with himself.", " The supreme criterion of fitness for ruling others is, in Plato and in the aristocratic tradition of the West, the capacity to rule one\u2019s self.", " Just as the philosopher-king commands the city, the soul commands the body and reason commands the passions.", " In Plato himself, the legitimacy of this tyranny in everything pertaining to man, his conduct toward himself no less than his conduct toward others, is still firmly rooted in the equivocal significance of the word archein, which means both beginning and ruling; it is decisive for Plato, as he says expressly at the end of the Laws, that only the beginning ( arche ) is entitled to rule {archein ) .", " In the tradition of Platonic thought, this original, linguistically predetermined identity of ruling and beginning had the consequence that all beginning was understood as the 64.", " Republic 443E.", " Action legitimation for rulership, until, finally, the element of beginning disappeared altogether from the concept of rulership.", " With it the most elementary and authentic understanding of human freedom disappeared from political philosophy.", " The Platonic separation of knowing and doing has remained at the root of all theories of domination which are not mere justifications of an irreducible and irresponsible will to power.", " By sheer force of conceptualization and philosophical clarification, the Platonic identification of knowledge with command and rulership and of action with obedience and execution overruled all earlier experiences and articulations in the political realm and became authoritative for the whole tradition of political thought, even after the roots of experience from which Plato derived his concepts had long been forgotten.", " Apart from the unique Platonic mixture of depth and beauty, whose weight was bound to carry his thoughts through the centuries, the reason for the longevity of this particular part of his work is that he strengthened his substitution of rulership for action through an even more plausible interpretation in terms of making and fabrication.", " It is indeed true \u2014 and Plato, who had taken the key word of his philosophy, the term \u201cidea,\u201d from experiences in the realm of fabrication, must have been the first to notice it \u2014 that the division between knowing and doing, so alien to the realm of action, whose validity and meaningfulness are destroyed the moment thought and action part company, is an everyday experience in fabrication, whose processes obviously fall into two parts : first, perceiving the image or shape ( eidos ) of the product-to-be, and then organizing the means and starting the execution.", " The Platonic wish to substitute making for acting in order to bestow upon the realm of human affairs the solidity inherent in work and fabrication becomes most apparent where it touches the very center of his philosophy, the doctrine of ideas.", " When Plato was not concerned with political philosophy (as in the Symposium and elsewhere), he describes the ideas as what \u201cshines forth most\u201d (ekphanestaton) and therefore as variations of the beautiful.", " Only in the Republic were the ideas transformed into standards, measurements, and rules of behavior, all of which are variations or derivations of the idea of the \u201cgood\u201d in the Greek sense of the word, that is, of the \u201cgood for\u201d or of fitness .", " 65 This transformation was necessary to apply the doctrine of ideas to politics, and it is essentially for a political purpose, the purpose of eliminating the character of frailty from human affairs, that Plato found it necessary to declare the good, and not the beautiful, to be the highest idea.", " But this idea of the good is not the highest idea of the philosopher, who wishes to contemplate the true essence of Being and therefore leaves the dark cave of human affairs for the bright sky of ideas; even in the Republic , the philosopher is still defined as a lover of beauty, not of goodness.", " The good is the highest idea of the philosopherTmg, who wishes to be the ruler of human affairs because he must spend his life among men and cannot dwell forever under the sky of ideas.", " It is only when he returns to the dark cave of human affairs to live once more with his fellow men that he needs the ideas for guidance as standards and rules by which to measure and under which to subsume the varied multitude of human deeds and words with the same absolute, \u201cobjective\u201d certainty with which the craftsman can be guided in making and the layman in judging individual beds by using the unwavering ever-present model, the \u201cidea\u201d of bed in general .", " 66 Technically, the greatest advantage of this transformation and application of the doctrine of ideas to the political realm lay in the elimination of the personal element in the Platonic notion of ideal 65.", " The word ekphanestaton occurs in the Phaedrus (250) as the chief quality of the beautiful.", " In the Republic (518) a similar quality is claimed for the idea of the good, which is called phanotaton.", " Both words derive from phctinesthai (\u201cto appear\u201d and \u201cshine forth\u201d), and in both cases the superlative is used.", " Obviously, the quality of shining brightness applies to the beautiful much more than to the good.", " 66.", " Werner Jaeger\u2019s statement ( Paideia [1945], II, 416 n.", "), \u201cThe idea that there is a supreme art of measurement and that the philosopher\u2019s knowledge of value ( phronesis ) is the ability to measure, runs through all Plato\u2019s work right down to the end,\u201d is true only for Plato\u2019s political philosophy, where the idea of the good replaces the idea of the beautiful.", " The parable of the Cave, as told in the Republic , is the very center of Plato\u2019s political philosophy, but the doctrine of ideas as presented there must be understood as its application to politics, not as the original, purely philosophical development, which we cannot discuss here.", " Jaeger\u2019s characterization of the \u201cphilosopher\u2019s knowledge of values\u201d as phronesis indicates, in fact, the political and non-philosophical nature of this knowledge; for the very word phronesis characterizes in Plato and Aristotle the insight of the statesman rather than the vision of the philosopher.", " Action rulership.", " Plato knew quite well that his favorite analogies taken from household life, such as the master-slave or the shepherd-flock relationship, would demand a quasi-divine quality in the ruler of men to distinguish him as sharply from his subjects as the slaves are distinguished from the master or the sheep from the shepherd .", " 67 The construction of the public space in the image of a fabricated object, on the contrary, carried with it only the implication of ordinary mastership, experience in the art of politics as in all other arts, where the compelling factor lies not in the person of the artist or craftsman but in the impersonal object of his art or craft.", " In the Republic , the philosopher-king applies the ideas as the craftsman applies his rules and standards; he \u201cmakes\u201d his City as the sculptor makes a statue ; 68 and in the final Platonic work these same ideas have even become laws which need only be executed .", " 69 Within this frame of reference, the emergence of a utopian political system which could be construed in accordance with a model by somebody who has mastered the techniques of human affairs becomes almost a matter of course; Plato, who was the first to design a blueprint for the making of political bodies, has remained the inspiration of all later utopias.", " And although none of these utopias ever came to play any noticeable role in history \u2014 for in the few instances where utopian schemes were realized, they broke down quickly under the weight of reality, not so much the reality of exterior circumstances as of the real human relationships they could not control \u2014 they were among the most efficient vehicles to conserve and develop a tradition of political thinking in 67.", " In the Statesmen i, where Plato chiefly pursues this line of thought, he concludes ironically: Looking for someone who would be as fit to rule over man as the shepherd is to rule over his flock, we found \u201ca god instead of a mortal man\u201d (275).", " 68.", " Republic 420.", " 69.", " It may be interesting to note the following development in Plato\u2019s political theory: In the Republic, his division between rulers and ruled is guided by the relationship between expert and layman; in the Statesman, he takes his bearings from the relation between knowing and doing; and in the Laws, the execution of unchangeable laws is all that is left to the statesman or necessary for the functioning of the public realm.", " What is most striking in this development is the progressive shrinkage of faculties needed for the mastering of politics.", " which, consciously or unconsciously, the concept of action was interpreted in terms of making and fabrication.", " One thing, however, is noteworthy in the development of this tradition.", " It is true that violence, without which no fabrication could ever come to pass, has always played an important role in political schemes and thinking based upon an interpretation of action in terms of making; but up to the modern age, this element of violence remained strictly instrumental, a means that needed an end to justify and limit it, so that glorifications of violence as such are entirely absent from the tradition of political thought prior to the modern age.", " Generally speaking, they were impossible as long as contemplation and reason were supposed to be the highest capacities of man, because under this assumption all articulations of the vita activa, fabrication no less than action and let alone labor, remained themselves secondary and instrumental.", " Within the narrower sphere of political theory, the consequence was that the notion of rule and the concomitant questions of legitimacy and rightful authority played a much more decisive role than the understanding and interpretations of action itself.", " Only the modern age\u2019s conviction that man can know only what he makes, that his allegedly higher capacities depend upon making and that he therefore is primarily homo faber and not an animal rationale , brought forth the much older implications of violence inherent in all interpretations of the realm of human affairs as a sphere of making.", " This has been particularly striking in the series of revolutions, characteristic of the modern age, all of which \u2014 with the exception of the American Revolution \u2014 show the same combination of the old Roman enthusiasm for the foundation of a new body politic with the glorification of violence as the only means for \u201cmaking\u201d it.", " Marx\u2019s dictum that \u201cviolence is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one,\u201d that is, of all change in history and politics , 70 only sums up the conviction of the whole modern age and draws the consequences of its innermost belief that history is \u201cmade\u201d by men as nature is \u201cmade\u201d by God.", " 70.", " The quote is from Capital (Modern Library ed.", "), p.", " 824.", " Other passages in Marx show that he does not restrict his remark to the manifestation of social or economic forces.", " For example: \u201cIn actual history it is notorious that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly violence, play the great part\u201d {ibid.", ", 785) .", " Action How persistent and successful the transformation of action into a mode of making has been is easily attested by the whole terminology of political theory and political thought, which indeed makes it almost impossible to discuss these matters without using the category of means and ends and thinking in terms of instrumentality.", " Perhaps even more convincing is the unanimity with which popular proverbs in all modern languages advise us that \u201che who wants an end must also want the means\u201d and that \u201cyou can\u2019t make an omelette without breaking eggs.", "\u201d We are perhaps the first generation which has become fully aware of the murderous consequences inherent in a line of thought that forces one to admit that all means, provided that they are efficient, are permissible and justified to pursue something defined as an end.", " However, in order to escape these beaten paths of thought it is not enough to add some qualifications, such as that not all means are permissible or that under certain circumstances means may be more important than ends; these qualifications either take for granted a moral system which, as the very exhortations demonstrate, can hardly be taken for granted, or they are overpowered by the very language and analogies they use.", " For to make a statement about ends that do not justify all means is to speak in paradoxes, the definition of an end being precisely the justification of the means; and paradoxes always indicate perplexities, they do not solve them and hence are never convincing.", " As long as we believe that we deal with ends and means in the political realm, we shall not be able to prevent anybody\u2019s using all means to pursue recognized ends.", " The substitution of making for acting and the concomitant degradation of politics into a means to obtain an allegedly \u201chigher\u201d end\u2014 in antiquity the protection of the good men from the rule of the bad in general, and the safety of the philosopher in particular , 71 in the Middle Ages the salvation of souls, in the modern age the productivity and progress of society \u2014 is as old as the tradition of political philosophy.", " It is true that only the modern age defined man primarily as homo faber, a toolmaker and producer of things, 71.", " Compare Plato\u2019s statement that the wish of the philosopher to become a ruler of men can spring only from the fear of being ruled by those who are worse {Republic 347) with Augustine\u2019s statement that the function ol government is to enable \u201cthe good\u201d to live more quietly among \u201cthe bad\u201d ( Epistolae 153.", " 6).", " and therefore could overcome the deep-seated contempt and suspicion in which the tradition had held the whole sphere of fabrication.", " Yet, this same tradition, in so far as it also had turned against action \u2014 less openly, to be sure, but no less effectively \u2014 had been forced to interpret acting in terms of making, and thereby, its suspicion and contempt notwithstanding, had introduced into political philosophy certain trends and patterns of thought upon which the modern age could fall back.", " In this respect, the modern age did not reverse the tradition but rather liberated it from the \u201cprejudices\u201d which had prevented it from declaring openly that the work of the craftsman should rank higher than the \u201cidle\u201d opinions and doings which constitute the realm of human affairs.", " The point is that Plato and, to a lesser degree, Aristotle, who thought craftsmen not even worthy of full-fledged citizenship, were the first to propose handling political matters and ruling political bodies in the mode of fabrication.", " This seeming contradiction clearly indicates the depth of the authentic perplexities inherent in the human capacity for action and the strength of the temptation to eliminate its risks and dangers by introducing into the web of human relationships the much more reliable and solid categories inherent in activities with which we confront nature and build the world of the human artifice.", " 32 THE PROCESS CHARACTER OF ACTION The instrumentalization of action and the degradation of politics into a means for something else has of course never really succeeded in eliminating action, in preventing its being one of the decisive human experiences, or in destroying the realm of human affairs altogether.", " We saw before that in our world the seeming elimination of labor, as the painful effort to which all human life is bound, had first of all the consequence that work is now performed in the mode of laboring, and the products of work, objects for use, are consumed as though they were mere consumer goods.", " Similarly, the attempt to eliminate action because of its uncertainty and to save human affairs from their frailty by dealing with them as though they were or could become the planned products of human making has first of all resulted in channeling the human capacity Action for action, for beginning new and spontaneous processes which without men never would come into existence, into an attitude toward nature which up to the latest stage of the modern age had been one of exploring natural laws and fabricating objects out of natural material.", " To what an extent we have begun to act into nature, in the literal sense of the word, is perhaps best illustrated by a recent, casual remark of a scientist who quite seriously suggested that \u201cbasic research is when I am doing what I don\u2019t know what I am doing .", "\u201d 72 This started harmlessly enough with the experiment in which men were no longer content to observe, to register, and contemplate whatever nature was willing to yield in her own appearance, but began to prescribe conditions and to provoke natural processes.", " What then developed into an ever-increasing skill in unchaining elemental processes, which, without the interference of men, would have lain dormant and perhaps never have come to pass, has finally ended in a veritable art of \u201cmaking\u201d nature, that is, of creating \u201cnatural\u201d processes which without men would never exist and which earthly nature by herself seems incapable of accomplishing, although similar or identical processes may be commonplace phenomena in the universe surrounding the earth.", " Through the introduction of the experiment, in which we prescribed man-thought conditions to natural processes and forced them to fall into man-made patterns, we eventually learned how to \u201crepeat the process that goes on in the sun,\u201d that is, how to win from natural processes on the earth those energies which without us develop only in the universe.", " The very fact that natural sciences have become exclusively sciences of process and, in their last stage, sciences of potentially irreversible, irremediable \u201cprocesses of no return\u201d is a clear indication that, whatever the brain power necessary to start them, the actual underlying human capacity which alone could bring about this development is no \u201ctheoretical\u201d capacity, neither contemplation nor reason, but the human ability to act \u2014 to start new unprecedented processes whose outcome remains uncertain and unpre72.", " Quoted from an interview with Wernher von Braun, as reported in the New York Times, December 16, 1957.", " dictable whether they are let loose in the human or the natural realm.", " In this aspect of action \u2014 all-important to the modern age, to its enormous enlargement of human capabilities as well as to its unprecedented concept and consciousness of history \u2014 processes are started whose outcome is unpredictable, so that uncertainty rather than frailty becomes the decisive character of human affairs.", " This property of action had escaped the attention of antiquity, by and large, and had, to say the least, hardly found adequate articulation in ancient philosophy, to which the very concept of history as we know it is altogether alien.", " The central concept of the two entirely new sciences of the modern age, natural science no less than historical, is the concept of process, and the actual human experience underlying it is action.", " Only because we are capable of acting, of starting processes of our own, can we conceive of both nature and history as systems of processes.", " It is true that this character of modern thinking first came to the fore in the science of history, which, since Vico, has been consciously presented as a \u201cnew science,\u201d while the natural sciences needed several centuries before they were forced by the very results of their triumphal achievements to exchange an obsolete conceptual framework for a vocabulary that is strikingly similar to the one used in the historical sciences .", " However that may be, only under certain historical circumstances does frailty appear to be the chief characteristic of human affairs.", " The Greeks measured them against the ever-presence or eternal recurrence of all natural things, and the chief Greek concern was to measure up to and become worthy of an immortality which surrounds men but which mortals do not possess.", " To people who are not possessed by this concern with immortality, the realm of human affairs is bound to show an altogether different, even somehow contradictory aspect, namely, an extraordinary resiliency whose force of persistence and continuity in time is far superior to the stable durability of the solid world of things.", " Whereas men have always been capable of destroying whatever was the product of human hands and have become capable today even of the potential destruction of what man did not make\u2014 the earth and earthly nature \u2014 men never have been and never will be able to undo Action or even to control reliably any of the processes they start through action.", " Not even oblivion and confusion, which can cover up so efficiently the origin and the responsibility for every single deed, are able to undo a deed or prevent its consequences.", " And this incapacity to undo what has been done is matched by an almost equally complete incapacity to foretell the consequences of any deed or even to have reliable knowledge of its motives .", " 73 While the strength of the production process is entirely absorbed in and exhausted by the end product, the strength of the action process is never exhausted in a single deed but, on the contrary, can grow while its consequences multiply; what endures in the realm of human affairs are these processes, and their endurance is as unlimited, as independent of the perishability of material and the mortality of men as the endurance of humanity itself.", " The reason why we are never able to foretell with certainty the outcome and end of any action is simply that action has no end.", " The process of a single deed can quite literally endure throughout time until mankind itself has come to an end.", " That deeds possess such an enormous capacity for endurance, superior to every other man-made product, could be a matter of pride if men were able to bear its burden, the burden of irreversibility and unpredictability, from which the action process draws its very strength.", " That this is impossible, men have always known.", " They have known that he who acts never quite knows what he is doing, that he always becomes \u201cguilty\u201d of consequences he never intended or even foresaw, that no matter how disastrous and unexpected the consequences of his deed he can never undo it, that the process he starts is never consummated unequivocally in one single deed or event, and that its very meaning never discloses itself to the actor but only to the backward glance of the historian who himself does not act.", " All this is reason enough to turn away with despair from the realm of human affairs and to hold in contempt the human capacity for freedom, which, by producing the web of human relationships, seems to entangle its producer to such an ex73.", " \u201cMan weiss die Herkunft nieht, man weiss die Folgen nicht .", " .", " .", " fder Wert der Handlung ist] unbekannt,\u201d as Nietzsche once put it (Wille zur Macht, No.", " 291), hardly aware that he only echoed the age-old suspicion of the philosopher against action.", " tent that he appears much more the victim and the sufferer than the author and doer of what he has done.", " Nowhere, in other words, neither in labor, subject to the necessity of life, nor in fabrication, dependent upon given material, does man appear to be less free than in those capacities whose very essence is freedom and in that realm which owes its existence to nobody and nothing but man.", " It is in accordance with the great tradition of Western thought to think along these lines : to accuse freedom of luring man into necessity, to condemn action, the spontaneous beginning of something new, because its results fall into a predetermined net of relationships, invariably dragging the agent with them, who seems to forfeit his freedom the very moment he makes use of it.", " The only salvation from this kind of freedom seems to lie in non-acting, in abstention from the whole realm of human affairs as the only means to safeguard one\u2019s sovereignty and integrity as a person.", " If we leave aside the disastrous consequences of these recommendations (which materialized into a consistent system of human behavior only in Stoicism), their basic error seems to lie in that identification of sovereignty with freedom which has always been taken for granted by political as well as philosophic thought.", " If it were true that sovereignty and freedom are the same, then indeed no man could be free, because sovereignty, the ideal of uncompromising self-sufficiency and mastership, is contradictory to the very condition of plurality.", " No man can be sovereign because not one man, but men, inhabit the earth \u2014 and not, as the tradition since Plato holds, because of man\u2019s limited strength, which makes him depend upon the help of others.", " All the recommendations the tradition has to offer to overcome the condition of non-sovereignty and win an untouchable integrity of the human person amount to a compensation for the intrinsic \u201cweakness\u201d of plurality.", " Yet, if these recommendations were followed and this attempt to overcome the consequences of plurality were successful, the result would be not so much sovereign domination of one\u2019s self as arbitrary domination of all others, or, as in Stoicism, the exchange of the real world for an imaginary one where these others would simply not exist.", " In other words, the issue here is not strength or weakness in the sense of self-sufficiency.", " In polytheist systems, for instance, even a Action god, no matter how powerful, cannot be sovereign; only under the assumption of one god (\u201cOne is one and all alone and evermore shall be so\u201d) can sovereignty and freedom be the same.", " Under all other circumstances, sovereignty is possible only in imagination, paid for by the price of reality.", " Just as Epicureanism rests on the illusion of happiness when one is roasted alive in the Phaleric Bull, Stoicism rests on the illusion of freedom when one is enslaved.", " Both illusions testify to the psychological power of imagination, but this power can exert itself only as long as the reality of the world and the living, where one is and appears to be either happy or unhappy, either free or slave, are eliminated to such an extent that they are not even admitted as spectators to the spectacle of selfdelusion.", " If we look upon freedom with the eyes of the tradition, identifying freedom with sovereignty, the simultaneous presence of freedom and non-sovereignty, of being able to begin something new and of not being able to control or even foretell its consequences, seems almost to force us to the conclusion that human existence is absurd .", " 74 In view of human reality and its phenomenal evidence, it is indeed as spurious to deny human freedom to act because the actor never remains the master of his acts as it is to maintain that human sovereignty is possible because of the incontestable fact of human freedom .", " 76 'I he question which then arises is whether our notion that freedom and nonsovereignty are mutually exclusive is 74.", " This \u201cexistentialist\u201d conclusion is much less due to an authentic revision of traditional concepts and standards than it appears to be; actually, it still operates within the tradition and with traditional concepts, though in a certain spirit of rebellion.", " The most consistent result of this rebellion is therefore a return to \u201creligious values\u201d which, however, have no root any longer in authentic religious experiences or faith, but are like all modern spiritual \u201cvalues,\u201d exchange values, obtained in this case for the discarded \u201cvalues\u201d of despair.", " 75.", " Where human pride is still intact, it is tragedy rather than absurdity which is taken to be the hallmark of human existence.", " Its greatestyepresentative is Kant, to whom the spontaneity of acting, and the concomitant faculties of practical reason, including force of judgment, remain the outstanding qualities of man, even though his action falls into the determinism of natural laws and his judgment cannot penetrate the secret of absolute reality (the Ding an sich ) .", " Kant had the courage to acquit man from the consequences of his deed, insisting solely on the purity of his motives, and this saved him from losing faith in man and his potential greatness, not defeated by reality, or to put it another way, whether the capacity for action does not harbor within itself certain potentialities which enable it to survive the disabilities of non-sovereignty.", " 33 IRREVERSIBILITY AND THE POWER TO FORGIVE We have seen that the animal laborans could be redeemed from its predicament of imprisonment in the ever-recurring cycle of the life process, of being forever subject to the necessity of labor and consumption, only through the mobilization of another human capacity, the capacity for making, fabricating, and producing of homo faber, who as a toolmaker not only eases the pain and trouble of laboring but also erects a world of durability.", " The redemption of life, which is sustained by labor, is worldliness, which is sustained by fabrication.", " We saw furthermore that homo faber could be redeemed from his predicament of meaninglessness, the \u201cdevaluation of all values,\u201d and the impossibility of finding valid standards in a world determined by the category of means and ends, only through the interrelated faculties of action and speech, which produce meaningful stories as naturally as fabrication produces use objects.", " If it were not outside the scope of these considerations, one could add the predicament of thought to these instances; for thought, too, is unable to \u201cthink itself\u201d out of the predicaments which the very activity of thinking engenders.", " What in each of these instances saves man\u2014 man qua animal laborans , qua homo faber, qua thinker \u2014 is something altogether different; it comes from the outside \u2014 not, to be sure, outside of man, but outside of each of the respective activities.", " From the viewpoint of the animal laborans , it is like a miracle that it is also a being which knows of and inhabits a world; from the viewpoint of ho'/no faber , it is like a miracle, like the revelation of divinity, that meaning should have a place in this world.", " The case of action and action\u2019s predicaments is altogether different.", " Here, the remedy against the irreversibility and unpredictability of the process started by acting does not arise out of another and possibly higher faculty, but is one of the potentialities Action of action itself.", " The possible redemption from the predicament of irreversibility \u2014 of being unable to undo what one has done though one did not, and could not, have known what he was doing \u2014 is the faculty of forgiving.", " The remedy for unpredictability, for the chaotic uncertainty of the future, is contained in the faculty to make and keep promises.", " The two faculties belong together in so far as one of them, forgiving, serves to undo the deeds of the past, whose \u201csins\u201d hang like Damocles\u2019 sword over every new generation; and the other, binding oneself through promises, serves to set up in the ocean of uncertainty, which the future is by definition, islands of security without which not even continuity, let alone durability of any kind, would be possible in the relationships between men.", " Without being forgiven, released from the consequences of what we have done, our capacity to act would, as it were, be confined to one single deed from which we could never recover; we would remain the victims of its consequences forever, not unlike the sorcerer\u2019s apprentice who lacked the magic formula to break the spell.", " Without being bound to the fulfilment of promises, we would never be able to keep our identities; we would be condemned to wander helplessly and without direction in the darkness of each man\u2019s lonely heart, caught in its contradictions and equivocalities a darkness which only the light shed over the public realm through the presence of others, who confirm the identity between the one who promises and the one who fulfils, can dispel.", " Both faculties, therefore, depend on plurality, on the presence and acting of others, for no one can forgive himself and no one can feei bound by a promise made only to himself; forgiving and promising enacted in solitude or isolation remain without reality and can signify no more than a role played before one\u2019s self.", " Since these faculties correspond so closely to the human condition of plurality, their role in politics establishes a diametrically different set of guiding principles from the \u201cmoral\u201d standards inherent in the Platonic notion of rule.", " For Platonic rulership, whose legitimacy rested upon the domination of the self, draws its guiding principles \u2014 those which at the same time justify and limit power over others \u2014 from a relationship established between me and myself, so that the right and wrong of relationships with others are determined by attitudes toward one\u2019s self, until the whole of the public realm is seen in the image of \u201cman writ large,\u201d of the right order between man\u2019s individual capacities of mind, soul, and body.", " The moral code, on the other hand, inferred from the faculties of forgiving and of.", "making promises, rests on experiences which nobody could ever have with himself, which, on the contrary, are entirely based on the presence of others.", " And just as the extent and modes of self-rule justify and determine rule over others \u2014 how one rules himself, he will rule others\u2014 thus the extent and modes of being forgiven and being promised determine the extent and modes in which one may be able to forgive himself or keep promises concerned only with himself.", " Because the remedies against the enormous strength and resiliency inherent in action processes can function only under the condition of plurality, it is very dangerous to use this faculty in any but the realm of human affairs.", " Modern natural science and technology, which no longer observe or take material from or imitate processes of nature but seem actually to act into it, seem, by the same token, to have carried irreversibility and human unpredictability into the natural realm, where no remedy can be found to undo what has been done.", " Similarly, it seems that one of the great dangers of acting in the mode of making and within its categorical framework of means and ends lies in the concomitant self-deprivation of the remedies inherent only in action, so that one is bound not only to do with the means of violence necessary for all fabrication, but also to undo what he has done as he undoes an unsuccessful object, by means of destruction.", " Nothing appears more manifest in these attempts than the greatness of human power, whose source lies in the capacity to act, and which without action\u2019s inherent remedies inevitably begins to overpower and destroy not man himself but the conditions under which life was given to him.", " The discoverer of the role of forgiveness in the realm of human affairs was Jesus of Nazareth.", " The fact that he made this discovery in a religious context and articulated it in religious language is no reason to take it any less seriously in a strictly secular sense.", " It has been in the nature of our tradition of political thought (and for reasons we cannot explore here) to be highly selective and to exclude from articulate conceptualization a great variety of authentic Action political experiences, among which we need not be surprised to find some of an even elementary nature.", " Certain aspects of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth which are not primarily related to the Christian religious message but sprang from experiences in the small and closely knit community of his followers, bent on challenging the public authorities in Israel, certainly belong among them, even though they have been neglected because of their allegedly exclusively religious nature.", " The only rudimentary sign of an awareness that forgiveness may be the necessary corrective for the inevitable damages resulting from action may be seen in the Roman principle to spare the vanquished (par cere subiectis ) \u2014 a wisdom entirely unknown to the Greeks \u2014 or in the right to commute the death sentence, probably also of Roman origin, which is the prerogative of nearly all Western heads of state.", " It is decisive in our context that Jesus maintains against the \u201cscribes and pharisees\u201d first that it is not true that only God has the power to forgive , 76 and second that this power does not derive from God \u2014 as though God, not men, would forgive through the medium of human beings \u2014 but on the contrary must be mobilized by men toward each other before they can hope to be forgiven by God also.", " Jesus\u2019 formulation is even more radical.", " Man in the gospel is not supposed to forgive because God forgives and he must do \u201clikewise,\u201d but \u201cif ye from your hearts forgive,\u201d God shall do \u201clikewise .", "\u201d 77 The reason for the insistence on a duty to forgive is clearly \u201cfor they know not what they do\u201d and it does not apply to the extremity of crime and willed evil, for then it would not have been necessary to teach: \u201cAnd if he trespass 76.", " This is stated emphatically in Luke 5:21-24 (cf.", " Matt.", " 9:4-6 or Mark 12:7-10), where Jesus performs a miracle to prove that \u201cthe Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,\u201d the emphasis being on \u201cupon earth.", "\u201d It is his insistence on the \u201cpower to forgive,\u201d even more than his performance of miracles, that shocks the people, so that \u201cthey that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgives sins also?\u201d (Luke 7:49).", " 77.", " Matt.", " 18 : 35; cf.", " Mark 11 :25; \u201cAnd when ye stand praying, forgive, .", " .", " .", " that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.", "\u201d Or: \u201cIf ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses\u201d (Matt.", " 6: 14-15).", " In all these instances, the power to forgive is primarily a human power: God forgives \u201cus our debts, as we forgive our debtors.", "\u201d against thee seven times a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him .", "\u201d 78 Crime and willed evil are rare, even rarer perhaps than good deeds; according to Jesus, they will be taken care of by God in the Last Judgment, which plays no role whatsoever in life on earth, and the Last Judgment is not characterized by forgiveness but by just retribution (apodounai) .", " 79 But trespassing is an everyday occurrence which is in the very nature of action\u2019s constant establishment of new relationships within a web of relations, and it needs forgiving, dismissing, in order to make it possible for life to go on by constantly releasing men from what they have done unknowingly .", " 80 Only through this constant mutual release from what they do can men remain free agents, only by constant willingness to change their minds and start again can they be trusted with so great a power as that to begin something new.", " In this respect, forgiveness is the exact opposite of vengeance, which acts in the form of re-acting against an original trespassing, whereby far from putting an end to the consequences of the first misdeed, everybody remains bound to the process, permitting the chain reaction contained in every action to take its unhindered 78.", " Luke 17:3-4.", " It is important to keep in mind that the three key words of the text \u2014 aphienai, metanoein, and hamartanein \u2014 carry certain connotations even in New Testament Greek which the translations fail to render fully.", " The original meaning of aphienai is \u201cdismiss\u201d and \u201crelease\u201d rather than \u201cforgive\u201d; metanoein means \u201cchange of mind\u201d and\u2014 since it serves also to render the Hebrew shuv \u2014 \u201creturn,\u201d \u201ctrace back one\u2019s steps,\u201d rather than \u201crepentance\u201d with its psychological emotional overtones; what is required is: change your mind and \u201csin no more,\u201d which is almost the opposite of doing penance.", " Hamartanein , finally, is indeed very well rendered by \u201ctrespassing\u201d in so far as it means rather \u201cto miss,\u201d \u201cfail and go astray,\u201d than \u201cto sin\u201d (see Heinrich Ebeling, Griechisck-deutsches Worterbuch zum Neuen Testamente [1923]).", " The verse which I quote in the standard translation could also be rendered as follows: \u201cAnd if he trespass against thee .", " .", " .", " and .", " .", " .", " turn again to thee, saying, / changed my mind ; thou shalt release him.", "\u201d 79.", " Matt.", " 16:27.", " 80.", " This interpretation seems justified by the context (Luke 17 :l-5): Jesus introduces his words by pointing to the inevitability of \u201coffenses\u201d ( skandala ) which are unforgivable, at least on earth; for \u201cwoe unto him, through whom they come! It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea\u201d; and then continues by teaching forgiveness for \u201ctrespassing\u201d (hamartanein ) .", " Action course.", " In contrast to revenge, which is the natural, automatic reaction to transgression and which because of the irreversibility of the action process can be expected and even calculated, the act of forgiving can never be predicted; it is the only reaction that acts in an unexpected way and thus retains, though being a reaction, something of the original character of action.", " Forgiving, in other words, is the only reaction which does not merely re-act but acts anew and unexpectedly, unconditioned by the act which provoked it and therefore freeing from its consequences both the one who forgives and the one who is forgiven.", " The freedom contained in Jesus\u2019 teachings of forgiveness is the freedom from vengeance, which incloses both doer and sufferer in the relentless automatism of the action process, which by itself need never come to an end.", " The alternative to forgiveness, but by no means its opposite, is punishment, and both have in common that they attempt to put an end to something that without interference could go on endlessly.", " It is therefore quite significant, a structural element in the realm of human affairs, that men are unable to forgive what they cannot punish and that they are unable to punish what has turned out to be unforgivable.", " This is the true hallmark of those offenses which, since Kant, we call \u201cradical evil\u201d and about whose nature so little is known, even to us who have been exposed to one of their rare outbursts on the public scene.", " All we know is that we can neither punish nor forgive such offenses and that they therefore transcend the realm of human affairs and the potentialities of human power, both of which they radically destroy wherever they make their appearance.", " Here, where the deed itself dispossesses us of all power, we can indeed only repeat with Jesus: \u201cIt were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea.", "\u201d Perhaps the most plausible argument that forgiving and acting are as closely connected as destroying and making comes from that aspect of forgiveness where the undoing of what was done seems to show the same revelatory character as the deed itself.", " Forgiving and the relationship it establishes is always an eminently personal (though not necessarily individual or private) affair in which what was done is forgiven for the sake of who did it.", " This, too, was clearly recognized by Jesus (\u201cHer sins which are many are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little\u201d), and it is the reason for the current conviction that only love has the power to forgive.", " For love, although it is one of the rarest occurrences in human lives , 81 indeed possesses an unequaled power of self-revelation and an unequaled clarity of vision for the disclosure of who, precisely because it is unconcerned to the point of total unworldliness with what the loved person may be, with his qualities and shortcomings no less than with his achievements, failings, and transgressions.", " Love, by reason of its passion, destroys the in-between which relates us to and separates us from others.", " As long as its spell lasts, the only in-between which can insert itself between two lovers is the child, love\u2019s own product.", " The child, this in-between to which the lovers now are related and which they hold in common, is representative of the world in that it also separates them; it is an indication that they will insert a new world into the existing world .", " 82 Through the child, it is as though the lovers return to the world from which their love had expelled them.", " But this new worldliness, the possible result and the only possibly happy ending of a love affair, is, in a sense, the end of love, which must either overcome the partners anew or be transformed into another mode of belonging together.", " Love, by its very nature, is unworldly, and it is for this reason rather than its rarity that it is not only apolitical but antipolitical, perhaps the most powerful of all antipolitical human forces.", " If it were true, therefore, as Chrsitianity assumed, that only love can forgive because only love is fully receptive to who somebody 81.", " The common prejudice that love is as common as \u201cromance\u201d may be due to the fact that we all learned about it first through poetry.", " But the poets fool us; they are the only ones to whom love is not only a crucial, but an indispensable experience, which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one.", " 82.", " This world-creating faculty of love is not the same as fertility, upon which most creation myths are based.", " The following mythological tale, on the contrary, draws its imagery clearly from the experience of love: the sky is seen as a gigantic goddess who still bends down upon the earth god, from whom she is being separated by the air god who was born between them and is now lifting her up.", " Thus a world space composed of air comes into being and inserts itself between earth and sky.", " See H.", " A.", " Frankfort, The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man (Chicago, 1946), p.", " 18, and Mircea Eliade, Traite d\u2019 Histone des Religions (Paris, 1953), p.", " 212.", " Action is, to the point of being always willing to forgive him whatever he may have done, forgiving would have to remain altogether outside our considerations.", " Yet what love is in its own, narrowly circumscribed sphere, respect is in the larger domain of human affairs.", " Respect, not unlike the Aristotelian philia politike, is a kind of \u201cfriendship\u201d without intimacy and without closeness; it is a regard for the person from the distance which the space of the world puts between us, and this regard is independent of qualities which we may admire or of achievements which we may highly esteem.", " Thus, the modern loss of respect, or rather the conviction that respect is due only where we admire or esteem, constitutes a clear symptom of the increasing depersonalization of public and social life.", " Respect, at any rate, because it concerns only the person, is quite sufficient to prompt forgiving of what a person did, for the sake of the person.", " But the fact that the same who, revealed in action and speech, remains also the subject of forgiving is the deepest reason why nobody can forgive himself; here, as in action and speech generally, we are dependent upon others, to whom we appear in a distinctness which we ourselves are unable to perceive.", " Closed within ourselves, we would never be able to forgive ourselves any failing or transgression because we would lack the experience of the person for the sake of whom one can forgive.", " 34 UNPREDICTABILITY AND THE POWER OF PROMISE In contrast to forgiving, which\u2014 perhaps because of its religious context, perhaps because of the connection with love attending its discovery \u2014 has always been deemed unrealistic and inadmissible in the public realm, the power of stabilization inherent in the faculty of making promises has been known throughout our tradition.", " We may trace it back to the Roman legal system, the inviolability of agreements and treaties (pacta sunt servanda ) ; or we may see its discoverer in Abraham, the man from Ur, whose whole story, as the Bible tells it, shows such a passionate drive toward making covenants that it is as though he departed from his country for no other reason than to try out the power of mutual promise in the wilderness of the world, until eventually God himself agreed to make a Covenant with him.", " At any rate, the great variety of contract theories since the Romans attests to the fact that the power of making promises has occupied the center of political thought over the centuries.", " The unpredictability which the act of making promises at least partially dispels is of a twofold nature: it arises simultaneously out of the \u201cdarkness of the human heart,\u201d that is, the basic unreliability of men who never can guarantee today who they will be tomorrow, and out of the impossibility of foretelling the consequences of an act within a community of equals where everybody has the same capacity to act.", " Man\u2019s inability to rely upon himself or to have complete faith in himself (which is the same thing) is the price human beings pay for freedom; and the impossibility of remaining unique masters of what they do, of knowing its consequences and relying upon the future, is the price they pay for plurality and reality, for the joy of inhabiting together with others a world whose reality is guaranteed for each by the presence of all.", " The function of the faculty of promising is to master this twofold darkness of human affairs and is, as such, the only alternative to a mastery which relies on domination of one\u2019s self and rule over others; it corresponds exactly to the existence of a freedom which was given under the condition of non-sovereignty.", " The danger and the advantage inherent in all bodies politic that rely on contracts and treaties is that they, unlike those that rely on rule and sovereignty, leave the unpredictability of human affairs and the unreliability of men as they are, using them merely as the medium, as it were, into which certain islands of predictability are thrown and in which certain guideposts of reliability are erected.", " The moment promises lose their character as isolated islands of certainty in an ocean of uncertainty, that is, when this faculty is misused to cover the whole ground of the future and to map out a path secured in all directions, they lose their binding power and the whole enterprise becomes self-defeating.", " We mentioned before the power generated when people gather together and \u201cact in concert,\u201d which disappears the moment they depart.", " The force that keeps them together, as distinguished from the space of appearances in which they gather and the power which Action keeps this public space in existence, is the force of mutual promise or contract.", " Sovereignty, which is always spurious if claimed by an isolated single entity, be it the individual entity of the person or the collective entity of a nation, assumes, in the case of many men mutually bound by promises, a certain limited reality.", " The sovereignty resides in the resulting, limited independence from the incalculability of the future, and its limits are the same as those inherent in the faculty itself of making and keeping promises.", " The sovereignty of a body of people bound and kept together, not by an identical will which somehow magically inspires them all, but by an agreed purpose for which alone the promises are valid and binding, shows itself quite clearly in its unquestioned superiority over those who are completely free, unbound by any promises and unkept by any purpose.", " This superiority derives from the capacity to dispose of the future as though it were the present, that is, the enormous and truly miraculous enlargement of the very dimension in which power can be effective.", " Nietzsche, in his extraordinary sensibility to moral phenomena, and despite his modern prejudice to see the source of all power in the will power of the isolated individual, saw in the faculty of promises (the \u201cmemory of the will,\u201d as he called it) the very distinction which marks off human from animal life .", " 83 If sovereignty is in the realm of action and human affairs what mastership is in the realm of making and the world of things, then their chief distinction is that the one can only be achieved by the many bound together, whereas the other is conceivable only in isolation.", " In so far as morality is more than the sum total of mores , of customs and standards of behavior solidified through tradition and valid on the ground of agreements, both of which change with time, it has, at least politically, no more to support itself than the good will to counter the enormous risks of action by readiness to forgive and to be forgiven, to make promises and to keep them.", " 83.", " Nietzsche saw with unequaled clarity the connection between human sovereignty and the faculty of making promises, which led him to a unique insight into the relatedness of human pride and human conscience.", " Unfortunately, both insights remained unrelated with and without effect upon his chief concept, the \u201cwill to power,\u201d and therefore are frequently overlooked even by Nietzsche scholars.", " They are to be found in the first two aphorisms of the second treatise in Zur Genealogie der Moral.", " These moral precepts are the only ones that are not applied to action from the outside, from some supposedly higher faculty or from experiences outside action\u2019s own reach.", " They arise, on the contrary, directly out of the will to live together with others in the mode of acting and speaking, and thus they are like control mechanisms built into the very faculty to start new and unending processes.", " If without action and speech, without the articulation of natality, we would be doomed to swing forever in the ever-recurring cycle of becoming, then without the faculty to undo what we have done and to control at least partially the processes we have let loose, we would be the victims of an automatic necessity bearing all the marks of the inexorable laws which, according to the natural sciences before our time, were supposed to constitute the outstanding characteristic of natural processes.", " We have seen before that to mortal beings this natural fatality, though it swings in itself and may be eternal, can only spell doom.", " If it were true that fatality is the inalienable mark of historical processes, then it would indeed be equally true that everything done in history is doomed.", " And to a certain extent this is true.", " If left to themselves, human affairs can only follow the law of mortality, which is the most certain and the only reliable law of a life spent between birth and death.", " It is the faculty of action that interferes with this law because it interrupts the inexorable automatic course of daily life, which in its turn, as we saw, interrupted and interfered with the cycle of the biological life process.", " The life span of man running toward death would inevitably carry everything human to ruin and destruction if it were not for the faculty of interrupting it and beginning something new, a faculty which is inherent in action like an ever-present reminder that men, though they must die, are not born in order to die but in order to begin.", " Yet just as, from the standpoint of nature, the rectilinear movement of man\u2019s life-span between birth and death looks like a peculiar deviation from the common natural rule of cyclical movement, thus action, seen from the viewpoint of the automatic processes which seem to determine the course of the world, looks like a miracle.", " In the language of natural science, it is the \u201cinfinite improbability which occurs regularly.", "\u201d Action is, in fact, the one miracle-working faculty of man, as Jesus Action of Nazareth, whose insights into this faculty can be compared in their originality and unprecedentedness with Socrates\u2019 insights into the possibilities of thought, must have known very well when he likened the power to forgive to the more general power of performing miracles, putting both on the same level and within the reach of man .", " 84 The miracle that saves the world, the realm of human affairs, from its normal, \u201cnatural\u201d ruin is ultimately the tact of natality, in which the faculty of action is ontologically rooted.", " It is, in other words, the birth of new men and the new beginning, the action they are capable of by virtue of being born.", " Only the full experience of this capacity can bestow upon human affairs faith and hope, those two essential characteristics of human existence which Greek antiquity ignored altogether, discounting the keeping of faith as a very uncommon and not too important virtue and counting hope among the evils of illusion in Pandora\u2019s box.", " It is this faith in and hope for the world that found perhaps its most glorious and most succinct expression in the few words with which the Gospels announced their \u201cglad tidings\u201d: \u201cA child has been born unto us.", "\u201d 84.", " Cf.", " the quotations given in n.", " 77.", " Jesus himself saw the human root of this power to perform miracles in faith \u2014 which we leave out of our considerations.", " In our context, the only point that matters is that the power to perform miracles is not considered to be divine \u2014 faith will move mountains and faith will forgive; the one is no less a miracle than the other, and the reply of the apostles when Jesus demanded of them to forgive seven times in a day was: \u201cLord, increase our faith.", "\u201d CHAPTER VI 5 SWI SWI (TWD SWT) cr^>W7) 6 The Vita A diva and the Modern Age 5 Er hat

character : the discovery of America and the ensuing exploration of the whole earth; the Reformation, which by expropriating ecclesiastical and monastic possessions started the twofold process of individual expropriation and the accumulation of social wealth; the invention of the telescope and the development of a new science that considers the nature of the earth from the viewpoint of the universe.", " These cannot be called modern events as we know them since the French Revolution, and although they cannot be explained by any chain of causality, because no event can, they are still happening in an unbroken continuity, in which precedents exist and predecessors can be named.", " None of them exhibits the peculiar character of an explosion of undercurrents which, having gathered their force in the dark, suddenly erupt.", " The names we connect with them, Galileo Galilei and Martin Luther and the great seafarers, explorers, and adventurers in the age of discovery, still belong to a premodern world.", " Moreover, the strange pathos of novelty, the almost violent insistence of nearly The Vita Activa and the Modern Age all the great authors, scientists, and philosophers since the seventeenth century that they saw things never seen before, thought thoughts never thought before, can be found in none of them, not even in Galileo .", " 1 These precursors are not revolutionists, and their motives and intentions are still securely rooted in tradition.", " In the eyes of their contemporaries, the most spectacular of these events must have been the discoveries of unheard-of continents and undreamed-of oceans; the most disturbing might have been the Reformation\u2019s irremediable split of Western Christianity, with its inherent challenge to orthodoxy as such and its immediate threat to the tranquillity of men\u2019s souls; certainly the least noticed was the addition of a new implement to man\u2019s already large arsenal of tools, useless except to look at the stars, even though it was the first purely scientific instrument ever devised.", " However, if we could measure the momentum of history as we measure natural processes, we might find that what originally had the least noticeable impact, man\u2019s first tentative steps toward the discovery of the universe, has constantly increased in momentousness as well as 1 .", " The term scienza nuova seems to occur for the first time in the work of the sixteenth-century Italian mathematician Niccolo Tartaglia, who designed the new science of ballistics which he claimed to have discovered because he was the first to apply geometrical reasoning to the motion of projectiles.", " (I owe this information to Professor Alexandre Koyre.", ") Of greater relevance in our context is that Galileo, in the Sidereus Nuncius (1610), insists on the \u201cabsolute novelty\u201d of his discoveries, but this certainly is a far cry from Hobbes s claim that political philosophy was \u201cno older than my own

not only the enlargement of the earth\u2019s surface, which found its final limitation only in the limitations of the globe itself, but also the still apparently limitless economic accumulation process.", " But these are mere speculations.", " As a matter of fact, the discovery of the earth, the mapping of her lands and the chartering of her waters, took many centuries and has only now begun to come to an end.", " Only now has man taken full possession of his mortal dwelling place and gathered the infinite horizons, which were temptingly and forbiddingly open to all previous ages, into a globe whose majestic outlines and detailed surface he knows as he knows the lines in the palm of his hand.", " Precisely when the immensity of available space on earth was discovered, the famous shrinkage of the globe began, until eventually in our world (which, though the result of the modern age, is by no means identical with the modern age\u2019s world) each man is as much an inhabitant of the earth as he is an inhabitant of his country.", " Men now live in an earth-wide continuous whole where even the notion of distance, still inherent in the most perfectly unbroken contiguity of parts, has yielded before the onslaught of speed.", " Speed has conquered space; and though this conquering process finds its limit at the unconquerable boundary of the simultaneous presence of one body at two different places, it has made distance meaningless, for no significant part of a human life \u2014 years, months, or even weeks-~is any longer necessary to reach any point on the earth.", " Nothing, to be sure, could have been more alien to the purpose of the explorers and circumnavigators of the early modern age than this closing-in process; they went to enlarge the earth, not shrink her into a ball, and when they submitted to the call of the distant, they had no intention of abolishing distance.", " Only the wisdom of hindsight sees the obvious, that nothing can remain immense if it can be measured, that every survey brings together distant parts and therefore establishes closeness where distance ruled before.", " Thus the maps and navigation charts of the early stages of the modern age anticipated the technical inventions through which all earthly space has become small and close at hand.", " Prior to the shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads, steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more The Vita Activa and the Modern Age effective shrinkage which comes about through the surveying capacity of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can condense and scale earthly physical distance down to the size of the human body\u2019s natural sense and understanding.", " Before we knew how to circle the earth, how to circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and swirled before our eyes.", " There is another aspect of this matter which, as we shall see, will be of greater importance in our context.", " It is in the nature of the human surveying capacity that it can function only if man disentangles himself from all involvement in and concern with the close at hand and withdraws himself to a distance from everything near him.", " The greater the distance between himself and his surroundings, world or earth, the more he will be able to survey and to measure and the less will worldly, earth-bound space be left to him.", " The fact that the decisive shrinkage of the earth was the consequence of the invention of the airplane, that is, of leaving the surface of the earth altogether, is like a symbol for the general phenomenon that any decrease of terrestrial distance can be won only at the price of putting a decisive distance between man and earth, of alienating man from his immediate earthly surroundings.", " The fact that the Reformation, an altogether different event, eventually confronts us with a similar phenomenon of alienation, which Max Weber even identified, under the name of \u201cinnerworldly asceticism,\u201d as the innermost spring of the new capitalist mentality, may be one of the many coincidences that make it so difficult for the historian not to believe in ghosts, demons, and Zeitgeists.", " What is so striking and disturbing is the similarity in utmost divergence.", " For this innerworldly alienation has nothing to do, either in intent or content, with the alienation from the earth inherent in the discovery and taking possession of the earth.", " Moreover, the innerworldly alienation whose historical factuality Max Weber demonstrated in his famous essay is not only present in the new morality that grew out of Luther\u2019s and Calvin\u2019s attempts to restore the uncompromising otherworldliness of the Christian faith; it is equally present, albeit on an altogether different level, in the expropriation of the peasantry, which was the unforeseen consequence of the expropriation of church property and, as such, the greatest single factor in the breakdown of the feudal system .", " 2 It is, of course, idle to speculate on what the course of our economy would have been without this event, whose impact propelled Western mankind into a development in which all property was destroyed in the process of its appropriation, all things devoured in the process of their production, and the stability of the world undermined in a constant process of change.", " Yet, such speculations are meaningful to the extent that they remind us that history is a story of events and not of forces or ideas with predictable courses.", " They are idle and even dangerous when used as arguments against reality and when meant to point to positive potentialities and alternatives, because their number is not only indefinite by definition but they also lack the tangible unexpectedness of the event, and compensate for it by mere plausibility.", " Thus, they remain sheer phantoms no matter in how pedestrian a manner they may be presented.", " In order not to underestimate the momentum this process has reached after centuries of almost unhindered development, it may be well to reflect on the so-called \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d of postwar Germany, a miracle only if seen in an outdated frame of reference.", " The German example shows very clearly that under modern conditions the expropriation of people, the destruction of objects, and the devastation of cities will turn out to be a radical stimulant for a process, not of mere recovery, but of quicker and more efficient accumulation of wealth \u2014 if only the country is modern enough to respond in terms of the production process.", " In Germany, outright destruction took the place of the relentless process of depreciation of all worldly things, which is the hallmark of the waste economy 2.", " This is not to'deny the greatness of Max Weber\u2019s discovery of the enormous power that comes from an otherworldliness directed toward the world (see \u201cProtestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism,\u201d in Religionssoziologie [1920], Vol.", " I).", " Weber finds the Protestant work ethos preceded by certain traits of monastic ethics, and one can indeed see a first germ of these attitudes in Augustine\u2019s famous distinction between uti and frui, between the things of this world which one may use but not enjoy and those of the world to come which may be enjoyed for their own sake.", " The increase in power of man over the things of this world springs in either case from the distance which man puts between himself and the world, that is, frpm world alienation.", " The Vita A ctiva and the Modern Age in which we now live.", " The result is almost the same: a booming prosperity which, as postwar Germany illustrates, feeds not on the abundance of material goods or on anything stable and given but on the process of production and consumption itself.", " Under modern conditions, not destruction but conservation spells ruin because the very durability of conserved objects is the greatest impediment to the turnover process, whose constant gain in speed is the only constancy left wherever it has taken hold .", " 3 We saw before that property, as distinguished from wealth and appropriation, indicates the privately owned share of a common world and therefore is the most elementary political condition for man\u2019s worldliness.", " By the same token, expropriation and world alienation coincide, and the modern age, very much against the intentions of all the actors in the play, began by alienating certain strata of the population from the world.", " We tend to overlook the central importance of this alienation for the modern age because we usually stress its secular character and identify the term secularity with worldliness.", " Yet secularization as a tangible historical event means no more than separation of Church and State, of religion and politics, and this, from a religious viewpoint, implies a return to the early Christian attitude of \u201cRender unto Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s and unto God the things that are God\u2019s\u201d rather than a loss of faith and transcendence or a new and emphatic interest in the things of this world.", " Modern loss of faith is not religious in origin \u2014 it cannot be traced to the Reformation and Counter Reformation, the two great religious movements of the modern age \u2014 and its scope is by no means restricted to the religious sphere.", " Moreover, even if we admitted that the modern age began with a sudden, inexplicable 3.", " The reason most frequently given for the surprising recovery of Germany \u2014 that she did not have to carry the burden of a military budget \u2014 is inconclusive on two accounts: first, Germany had to pay for a number of years the costs of occupation, which amounted to a sum almost equal to a full-fledged military budget, and second, war production is held in other economies to be the greatest single factor in the postwar prosperity.", " Moreover, the point I wish to make could be equally well illustrated by the common and yet quite uncanny phenomenom that prosperity is closely connected with the \u201cuseless\u201d production of means of destruction, of goods produced to be wasted either by using them up in destruction or \u2014 and this is the more common case \u2014 by destroying them because they soon become obsolete.", " eclipse of transcendence, of belief in a hereafter, it would by no means follow that this loss threw man back upon the world.", " The historical evidence, on the contrary, shows that modem men were not thrown back upon this world but upon themselves.", " One of the most persistent trends in modern philosophy since Descartes and perhaps its most original contribution to philosophy has been an exclusive concern with the self, as distinguished from the soul or person or man in general, an attempt to reduce all experiences, with the world as well as with other human beings, to experiences between man and himself.", " The greatness of Max Weber\u2019s discovery about the origins of capitalism lay precisely in his demonstration that an enormous, strictly mundane activity is possible without any care for or enjoyment of the world whatever, an activity whose deepest motivation, on the contrary, is worry and care about the self.", " World alienation, and not self-alienation as Marx thought , 4 has been the hallmark of the modem age.", " Expropriation, the deprivation for certain groups of their place 4.", " There are several indications in the writings of the young Marx that he was not altogether unaware of the implications of world alienation in capitalist economy.", " Thus, in the early article of 1842, \u201cDebatten liber das Holzdiebstahlsgesetz\u201d (see Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe [Berlin, 1932], Part I, Vol.", " I, pp.", " 266 ff.", "), he criticizes a law against theft not only because the formal opposition of owner and thief leaves \u201chuman needs\u201d out of account \u2014 the fact that the thief who uses the wood needs it more urgently than the owner who sells it \u2014 and therefore dehumanizes men by equating wood-user and wood-seller as wood proprietors, but also that the wood itself is deprived of its nature.", " A law which regards men only as property-owners considers things only as properties and properties only as exchange objects, not as use things.", " That things are denatured when they are used for exchange was probably suggested to Marx by Aristotle, who pointed out that though a shoe may be wanted for either usage or exchange, it is against the nature of a shoe to be exchanged, \u201cfor a shoe is not made to be an object of barter\u201d {Politics 12J7a8).", " (Incidentally the influence of Aristotle on the style of Marx\u2019s thought seems to me almost as characteristic and decisive as the influence of Hegel\u2019s philosophy.", ") However, such occasional considerations play a minor role in his work, which remained firmly rooted in the modem age\u2019s extreme subjectivism.", " In his ideal society, where men will produce as human beings, world alienation is even more present than it was before; for then they will be able to objectify (vergegenstdndlichen) their individuality, their peculiarity, to confirm and actualize their true being: \u201cUnsere Produktionen waren ebensoviele Spiegel, woraus unser Wesen sich entgegen leuchtete\u201d (\u201cAus den Exzerptheften\u201d [1844-45], in Gesamtausgabe, Part 1, Vol.", " Ill, pp.", " 546^47).", " The Vita Activa and the Modem Age in the world and their naked exposure to the exigencies of life, created both the original accumulation of wealth and the possibility of transforming this wealth into capital through labor.", " These together constituted the conditions for the rise of a capitalist economy.", " That this development, started by expropriation and fed upon it, would result in an enormous increase in human productivity was manifest from the beginning, centuries before the industrial revolution.", " The new laboring class, which literally lived from hand to mouth, stood not only directly under the compelling urgency of life\u2019s necessity 5 but was at the same time alienated from all cares and worries which did not immediately follow from the life process itself.", " What was liberated in the early stages of the first free laboring class in history was the force inherent in \u201clabor power,\u201d that is, in the sheer natural abundance of the biological process, which like all natural forces \u2014 of procreation no less than of laboring \u2014 provides for a generous surplus over and beyond the reproduction of young to balance the old.", " What distinguishes this development at the beginning of the modern age from similar occurrences in the past is that expropriation and wealth accumulation did not simply result in new property or lead to a new redistribution of wealth, but were fed back into the process to generate further expropriations, greater productivity, and more appropriation.", " In other words, the liberation of labor power as a natural process did not remain restricted to certain classes of society, and appropriation did not come to an end with the satisfaction of wants and desires; capital accumulation, therefore, did not lead to the stagnation we know so well from rich empires prior to the modern age, but spread throughout the society and initiated a steadily increasing flow of wealth.", " But this process, which indeed is the \u201clife process of society,\u201d as Marx used to call it, and whose wealthproducing capacity can be compared only with the fertility of natural processes where the creation of one man and one woman would suffice to produce by multiplication any given number of human beings, remains bound to the principle of world alienation from 5.", " This of course is markedly different from present conditions, where the day laborer has already become a weekly wage-earner; in a probably not very distant future the guaranteed annual wage will do away with these early conditions altogether.", " which it sprang; the process can continue only provided that no worldly durability and stability is permitted to interfere, only as long as all worldly things, all end products of the production process, are fed back into it at an ever-increasing speed.", " In other words, the process of wealth accumulation, as we know it, stimulated by the life process and in turn stimulating human life, is possible only if the world and the very worldliness of man are sacrificed.", " The first stage of this alienation was marked by its cruelty, the misery and material wretchedness it meant for a steadily increasing number of \u201clabouring poor,\u201d whom expropriation deprived of the twofold protection of family and property, that is, of a familyowned private share in the world, which until the modern age had housed the individual life process and the laboring activity subject to its necessities.", " The second stage was reached when society became the subject of the new life process, as the family had been its subject before.", " Membership in a social class replaced the protection previously offered by membership in a family, and social solidarity became a very efficient substitute for the earlier, natural solidarity ruling the family unit.", " Moreover, society as a whole, the \u201ccollective subject\u201d of the life process, by no means remained an intangible entity, the \u201ccommunist fiction\u201d needed by classical economics; just as the family unit had been identified with a privately owned piece of the world, its property, society was identified with a tangible, albeit collectively owned, piece of property, the territory of the nation-state, which until its decline in the twentieth century offered all classes a substitute for the privately owned home of which the class of the poor had been deprived.", " The organic theories of nationalism, especially in its Central European version, all rest on an identification of the nation and the relationships between its members with the family and family relationships.", " Because society becomes the substitute for the family, \u201cblood and soil\u201d is supposed to rule the relationships between its members; homogeneity of population and its rootedness in the soil of a given territory become the requisites for the nation-state everywhere.", " However, while this development undoubtedly mitigated cruelty and misery, it hardly influenced the process of expropriation and world alienation, since collective ownership, strictly speaking, is a contradiction in terms.", " The Vita Activa and the Modern Age The decline of the European nation-state system; the economic and geographic shrinkage of the earth, so that prosperity and depression tend to become world-wide phenomena; the transformation of mankind, which until our own time was an abstract notion or a guiding principle for humanists only, into a really existing entity whose members at the most distant points of the globe need less time to meet than the members of a nation needed a generation ago \u2014 these mark the beginnings of the last stage in this development.", " Just as the family and its property were replaced by class membership and national territory, so mankind now begins to replace nationally bound societies, and the earth replaces the limited state territory.", " But whatever the future may bring, the process of world alienation, started by expropriation and characterized by an ever-increasing progress in wealth, can only assume even more radical proportions if it is permitted to follow its own inherent law.", " For men cannot become citizens of the world as they are citizens of their countries, and social men cannot own collectively as family and household men own their private property.", " The rise of society brought about the simultaneous decline of the public as well as the private realm.", " But the eclipse of a common public world, so crucial to the formation of the lonely mass man and so dangerous in the formation of the worldless mentality of modern ideological mass movements, began with the much more tangible loss of a privately owned share in the world.", " 36 THE DISCOVERY OF THE ARCHIMEDEAN POINT \u201cSince a babe was born in a manger, it

astronomers, philosophers, and theologians\u2014 the telescope created no great excitement; public attention was drawn, rather, to Galileo\u2019s dramatic demonstration of the laws of falling bodies, taken to be the beginning of modern natural science (although it may be doubted that by themselves, without being transformed later by Newton into the universal law of gravitation \u2014 still one of the most grandiose examples of the modern amalgamation of astronomy and physics \u2014 they would ever have led the new science on the path of astrophysics) .", " For what most drastically distinguished the new world view not only from that of antiquity or the Middle Ages, but from the great thirst for direct experience in the Renaissance as well, was the assumption that the same kind of exterior force should be manifest in the fall of terrestrial and the movements of heavenly bodies.", " Moreover, the novelty of Galileo\u2019s discovery was clouded by its close relationship to antecedents and predecessors.", " Not the philosophical speculations of Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno alone, but the mathematically trained imagination of the astronomers, Copernicus and Kepler, had challenged the finite, geocentric world view which men had held since time immemorial.", " Not Galileo but the philosophers were the first to abolish the dichotomy between one earth and one sky above it, promoting, as they thought, the earth \u201cto the rank of the noble stars\u201d and finding her a home in an eternal and infinite universe .", " 7 And it seems the astronomers needed no telescope to assert that, contrary to all sense experience, it is not the sun that moves around the earth but the earth that circles the sun.", " If the historian looks back upon these beginnings with

Introspection, as a matter of fact, not the reflection of man\u2019s mind on the state of his soul or body but the sheer cognitive concern of consciousness with its own content (and this is the

interfering but the producer of the product, man is confronted with nothing and nobody but himself.", " Long before the natural and physical sciences began to wonder if man is capable of encountering, knowing, and comprehending anything except himself, modern philosophy had made sure in introspection that man concerns himself only with himself.", " Descartes believed that the certainty yielded by his new method of introspection is the certainty of the I-am .", " 40 Man, in other words, carries his certainty, the certainty of his existence, within himself; the sheer functioning of consciousness, though it cannot possibly assure a worldly reality given to the senses and to reason, confirms beyond doubt the reality of sensations and of reasoning, that is, the reality of processes which go on in the mind.", " These are not unlike cipes [Pleiade ed.", "], Part I, sec.", " 7).", " The argument itself is of course not new.", " One finds it, for instance, almost word for word in

of a philosophical system.", " 40.", " That the cogito ergo sum contains a logical error, that, as Nietzsche pointed out, it should read: cogito, ergo cogitationes sunt, and that therefore the mental

real, since they presuppose a dreamer and a dream, the world of consciousness is real enough.", " The trouble is only that just as it would be impossible to infer from the awareness of bodily processes the actual shape of any body, including one\u2019s own, so it is impossible to reach out from the mere consciousness of sensations, in which one senses his senses and in which even the sensed object becomes part of sensation, into reality with its shapes, forms, colors, and constellations.", " The seen tree may be real enough for the sensation of vision, just as the dreamed tree is real enough for the dreamer as long as the dream lasts, but neither can ever become a real tree.", " It is out of these perplexities that Descartes and Leibniz needed to prove, not the existence of God, but his goodness, the one demonstrating that no evil spirit rules the world and mocks man and the other that this world, including man, is the best of all possible worlds.", " The point about these exclusively modern justifications, known since Leibniz as theodicies, is that the doubt does not concern the existence of a highest being, which, on the contrary, is taken for granted, but concerns his revelation, as given in biblical tradition, and his intentions with respect to man and world, or rather the adequateness of the relationship between man and world.", " Of these two, the doubt that the Bible or nature contains divine revelation is a matter of course, once it has been shown that revelation as such, the disclosure of reality to the senses and of truth to reason, is no guaranty for either.", " Doubt of the goodness of God, however, the notion of a Dieu trompeur , arose out of the very experience of deception inherent in the acceptance of the new world view, a deception whose poignancy lies in its irremediable repetitiveness, for no knowledge about the heliocentric nature of our planetary system can change the fact that every day the sun is seen circling the earth, rising and setting at its preordained location.", " Only now, when it appeared as though man, if it had not been for the accident of the telescope, might have been deceived forever, did the ways of God really become wholly inscrutable; the more man learned about the universe, the less he could understand the intentions and purposes for which he should have been created.", " The goodness of the God of the theodicies, therefore, is strictly the quality of a deus ex machina ; inexplicable goodness is ultimately the only thing that saves reality in Descartes\u2019 philosophy (the coexistence of mind and extension, res cogitans and res extensd), as it saves the prestabilized harmony between man and world in Leibniz .", " 41 The very ingenuity of Cartesian introspection, and hence the reason why this philosophy became so all-important to the spiritual and intellectual development of the modern age, lies first in that it had used the nightmare of non-reality as a means of submerging all worldly objects into the stream of consciousness and its processes.", " The \u201cseen tree\u201d found in consciousness through introspection is no longer the tree given in sight and touch, an entity in itself with an unalterable identical shape of its own.", " By being processed into an object of consciousness on the same level with a merely remembered or entirely imaginary thing, it becomes part and parcel of this process itself, of that consciousness, that is, which one knows only as an ever-moving stream.", " Nothing perhaps could prepare our minds better for the eventual dissolution of matter into energy, of objects into a whirl of atomic occurrences, than this dissolution of objective reality into subjective states of mind or, rather, into subjective mental processes.", " Second, and this was of even greater relevance to the initial stages of the modern age, the Cartesian method of securing certainty against universal doubt corresponded most precisely to the most obvious conclusion to be drawn from the new physical science: though one cannot know truth as something given and disclosed, man can at least know what he makes himself.", " This, indeed, became the most general and most generally accepted attitude of the modern age, and it is this conviction, rather 41.", " This quality of God as a deus ex machina , as the only possible solution to universal doubt, is especially manifest in Descartes\u2019 Meditations.", " Thus, he says in the third meditation: In order to eliminate the cause of doubting, \u201cje dois examiner s\u2019il y a un Dieu .", " .", " .", " ; et si je trouve qu\u2019il y en ait un, je dois aussi examiner s\u2019il peut etre trompeur: car sans la connaissance de ces deux verites, je ne vois pas que je puisse jamais

of the hierarchical order between the vita contemplativa and the vita activa.", " In order to understand how compelling the motives for this reversal were, it is first of all necessary to rid ourselves of the current prejudice which ascribes the development of modern science, because of its applicability, to a pragmatic desire to improve conditions and better human life on earth.", " It is a matter of historical record that modern technology has its origins not in the evolution of those tools man had always devised for the twofold purpose of easing his labors and erecting the human artifice, but exclusively in an altogether non-practical search for useless knowledge.", " Thus, the watch, one of the first modern instruments, was not invented for purposes of practical life, but exclusively for the highly \u201ctheoretical\u201d purpose of conducting certain experiments with nature.", " This invention, to be sure, once its practical usefulness became apparent, changed the

would never have been any technology to speak of, and although today the already existing technical inventions carry a certain momentum which will probably generate improvements up to a certain point, it is not likely that our technically conditioned world could survive, let alone develop further, if we ever succeeded in convincing ourselves that man is primarily a practical being.", " However that may be, the fundamental experience behind the reversal of contemplation and action was precisely that man\u2019s thirst for knowledge could be assuaged only after he had put his trust into the ingenuity of his hands.", " The point was not that truth and knowledge were no longer important, but that they could be won only by \u201caction\u201d and not by contemplation.", " It was an instrument, the telescope, a work of man\u2019s hands, which finally forced nature, or rather the universe, to yield its secrets.", " The reasons for trusting doing and for distrusting contemplation or observation became even more cogent after the results of the first active inquiries.", " After being and appearance had parted company and truth was no longer supposed to appear, to reveal and disclose itself to the mental eye of a beholder, there arose a veritable necessity to hunt for truth behind deceptive appearances.", " Nothing indeed could be less trustworthy for acquiring knowledge and approaching truth than passive observation or mere contemplation.", " In order to be certain one had to make sure , and in order to know one had to do.", " Certainty of knowledge could be reached only under a twofold condition: first, that knowledge concerned only what one had done himself \u2014 so that its ideal became mathematical knowledge, where we deal only with self-made entities of the mind \u2014 and second, that knowledge was of such a nature that it could be tested only through more doing.", " Since then, scientific and philosophic truth have parted company; scientific truth not only need not be eternal, it need not even be comprehensible or adequate to human reason.", " It took many generations of scientists before the human mind grew bold enough to fully face this implication of modernity.", " If nature and the universe are products of a divine maker, and if the human mind is incapable of understanding what man has not made himself, then man cannot possibly expect to learn anything about nature that he can understand.", " He may be able, through ingenuity, to find out and even to imitate the devices of natural processes, but that does not mean these devices will ever make sense to him \u2014 they do not have to be intelligible.", " As a matter of fact, no supposedly suprarational divine revelation and no supposedly abstruse philosophic truth has

to-morrow be demonstrated truth .", "\u201d 55 Actually, the change that took place in the seventeenth century was more radical than what a simple reversal of the established traditional order between contemplation and doing is apt to indicate.", " The reversal, strictly speaking, concerned only the relationship between thinking and doing, whereas contemplation, in the original sense of beholding the truth, was altogether eliminated.", " For thought and contemplation are not the same.", " Traditionally, thought was conceived as the most direct and important way to lead to the contemplation of truth.", " Since Plato, and probably since Socrates, thinking was understood as the inner dialogue in which one speaks with himself (eme emauto, to recall the idiom current in Plato\u2019s dialogues); and although this dialogue lacks all outward manifestation and even requires a more or less complete cessation of all other activities, it constitutes in itself a highly active state.", " Its outward inactivity is clearly separated from the passivity, the complete stillness, in which truth is finally revealed to man.", " If medieval scholasticism looked upon philosophy as the handmaiden of theology, it could very well have appealed to Plato and Aristotle themselves; both, albeit in a very different context, considered this dialogical thought process to be the way to prepare the soul and lead the mind to a beholding of truth beyond thought and beyond speech \u2014 a truth that is arrheton, incapable of being communicated through words, as Plato put it , 66 or beyond speech, as in

" The radicality of this reversal is somehow obscured by another kind of reversal, with which it is frequently identified and which, since Plato, has dominated the history of Western thought.", " Whoever reads the Cave allegory in Plato\u2019s Republic in the light of Greek history will soon be aware that the periagoge, the turningabout that Plato demands of the philosopher, actually amounts to a reversal of the Homeric world order.", " Not life after death, as in the Homeric Hades, but ordinary life on earth, is located in a \u201ccave,\u201d in an underworld; the soul is not the shadow of the body, but the body the shadow of the soul; and the senseless, ghostlike motion ascribed by Homer to the lifeless existence of the soul after death in Hades is now ascribed to the senseless doings of men who do not leave the cave of human existence to behold the eternal ideas visible in the sky .", " 58 In this context, I am concerned only with the fact that the Platonic tradition of philosophical as well as political thought started with a reversal, and that this original reversal determined to a large extent the thought patterns into which Western philosophy almost automatically fell wherever it was not animated by a great and original philosophical impetus.", " Academic philosophy, as a matter of fact, has ever since been dominated by the never-ending reversals of idealism and materialism, of transcendentalism and immanentism, of realism and nominalism, of hedonism and asceticism, and so on.", " What matters here is the reversibility of all these systems, that they can be turned \u201cupside down\u201d or \u201cdownside up\u201d at any moment in history without requiring for such reversal either historical events or changes in the structural elements involved.", " The concepts themselves remain the same no matter where they 58.", " It is particularly Plato\u2019s use of the words eidolon and skia in the story of the Cave which makes the whole account read like

orders.", " Once Plato had succeeded in making these structural elements and concepts reversible, reversals within the course of intellectual history no longer needed more than purely intellectual experience, an experience within the framework of conceptual thinking itself.", " These reversals already began with the philosophical schools in late antiquity and have remained part of the Western tradition.", " It is still the same tradition, the same intellectual game with paired antitheses that rules, to an extent, the famous modern reversals of spiritual hierarchies, such as Marx\u2019s turning Hegelian dialectic upside down or Nietzsche\u2019s revaluation of the sensual and natural as against the supersensual and supernatural.", " The reversal we deal with here, the spiritual consequence of Galileo\u2019s discoveries, although it has frequently been interpreted in terms of the traditional reversals and hence as integral to the Western history of ideas, is of an altogether different nature.", " The conviction that objective truth is not given to man but that he can know only what he makes himself is not the result of skepticism but of a demonstrable discovery, and therefore does not lead to resignation but either to iv doubled activity or to despair.", " The world loss of modern philosophy, whose introspection discovered consciousness as the inner sense with which one senses his senses and found it to be the only guaranty of reality, is different not only in degree from the age-old suspicion of the philosophers toward the world and toward the others with whom they shared the world; the philosopher no longer turns from the world of deceptive perishability to another world of eternal truth, but turns away from both and withdraws into himself.", " What he discovers in the region of the inner self is, again, not an image whose permanence can be beheld and contemplated, but, on the contrary, the constant movement of sensual perceptions and the no less constantly moving activity of the mind.", " Since the seventeenth century, philosophy has produced the best and least disputed results when it has investigated, through a supreme effort of self-inspection, the processes of the senses and of the mind.", " In this aspect, most of modern philosophy is indeed theory of cognition and psychology, and in the few instances where the potentialities of the Cartesian method of introspection were fully realized by men like Pascal, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, one is tempted to say that philosophers have experimented with their own selves no less radically and perhaps even more fearlessly than the scientists experimented with nature.", " Much as we may admire the courage and respect the extraordinary ingenuity of philosophers throughout the modern age, it can hardly be denied that their influence and importance decreased as never before.", " It was not in the Middle Ages but in modern thinking that philosophy came to play second and even third fiddle.", " After Descartes based his own philosophy upon the discoveries of Galileo, philosophy has seemed condemned to be always one step behind the scientists and their ever more amazing discoveries, whose principles it has strived arduously to discover ex post facto and to fit into some over-all interpretation of the nature of human knowledge.", " As such, however, philosophy was not needed by the scientists, who \u2014 up to our time, at least \u2014 believed that they had no use for a handmaiden, let alone one who would \u201ccarry the torch in front of her gracious lady\u201d (Kant).", " The philosophers became either epistemologists, worrying about an over-all theory of science which the scientists did not need, or they became, indeed, what Hegel wanted them to be, the organs of the Zeitgeist, the mouthpieces in which the general mood of the time was expressed with conceptual clarity.", " In both instances, whether they looked upon nature or upon history, they tried to understand and come to terms with what happened without them.", " Obviously, philosophy suffered more from modernity than any other field of human endeavor; and it is difficult to say whether it suffered more from the almost automatic rise of activity to an altogether unexpected and unprecedented dignity or from the loss of traditional truth, that is, of the concept of truth underlying our whole tradition.", " 42 THE REVERSAL WITHIN THE Vita A CtlV (t and the victory of Homo Faber First among the activities within the vita activa to rise to the position formerly occupied by contemplation were the activities of making and fabricating \u2014 the prerogatives of homo faber.", " This was The Vita Activa and the Modern Age natural enough, since it had been an instrument and therefore man in so far as he is a toolmaker that led to the modern revolution.", " From then on, all scientific progress has been most intimately tied up with the ever more refined development in the manufacture of new tools and instruments.", " While, for instance, Galileo\u2019s experiments with the fall of heavy bodies could have been made at any time in history if men had been inclined to seek truth through experiments, Michelson\u2019s experiment with the interferometer at the end of the nineteenth century relied not merely on his \u201cexperimental genius\u201d but \u201crequired the general advance in technology,\u201d and therefore \u201ccould not have been made earlier than it was .", "\u201d 59 It is not only the paraphernalia of instruments and hence the help man had to enlist from homofaber to acquire knowledge that caused these activities to rise from their former humble place in the hierarchy of human capacities.", " Even more decisive was the element of making and fabricating present in the experiment itself, which produces its own phenomena of observation and therefore depends from the very outset upon man\u2019s productive capacities.", " The use of the experiment for the purpose of knowledge was already the consequence of the conviction that one can know only what he has made himself, for this conviction meant that one might learn about those things man did not make by figuring out and imitating the processes through which they had come into being.", " The much discussed shift of emphasis in the history of science from the old questions of \u201cwhat\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d something is to the new question of \u201chow\u201d it came into being is a direct consequence of this conviction, and its answer can only be found in the experiment.", " The experiment repeats the natural process as though man himself were about to make nature\u2019s objects, and although in the early stages of the modern age no responsible scientist would have dreamt of the extent to which man actually is capable of \u201cmaking\u201d nature, he nevertheless from the onset approached it from the standpoint of the One who made it, and this not for practical reasons of technical applicability but exclusively for the \u201ctheoretical\u201d reason that certainty in knowledge could not be gained otherwise: \u201cGive me matter and I will build a world from it, that is, give me matter and 59.", " Whitehead, Science and the Modern World , pp.", " 116-17.", " I will show you how a world developed from it .", "\u201d 60 These words of Kant show in a nutshell the modern blending of making and knowing, whereby it is as though a few centuries of knowing in the mode of making were needed as the apprenticeship to prepare modern man for making what he wanted to know.", " Productivity and creativity, which were to become the highest ideals and even the idols of the modern age in its initial stages, are inherent standards of homofaber , of man as a builder and fabricator.", " However, there is another and perhaps even more significant element noticeable in the modern version of these faculties.", " The shift from the \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d to the \u201chow\u201d implies that the actual objects of knowledge can no longer be things or eternal motions but must be processes, and that the object of science therefore is no longer nature or the universe but the history, the story of the coming into being, of nature or life or the universe.", " Long before the modern age developed its unprecedented historical consciousness and the concept of history became dominant in modern philosophy, the natural sciences had developed into historical disciplines, until in the nineteenth century they added to the older disciplines of physics and chemistry, of zoology and botany, the new natural sciences of geology or history of the earth, biology or the history of life, anthropology or the history of human life, and, generally, natural history.", " In all these instances, development, the key concept of the historical sciences, became the central concept of the physical sciences as well.", " Nature, because it could be known only in processes which human ingenuity, the ingeniousness of homo faber, could repeat and remake in the experiment, became a process , 61 and all particular natural things derived their significance and meaning solely from their functions in the over-all process.", " In the place of the concept of Being we now find the concept of Process.", " And whereas it is in the nature of Being to appear and thus disclose 60.", " \u201cGebet mir Materie, ich will eine Welt daraus bauen! das ist, gebet mir Materie, ich will euch zeigen,

nothing\u201d (see Whitehead, The Concept of Nature, pp.", " 53, 15, 66), belongs among the axioms of modern natural science in all its branches.", " The Vita Activa and the Modern Age itself, it is in the nature of Process to remain invisible, to be something whose existence can only be inferred from the presence of certain phenomena.", " This process was originally the fabrication process which \u201cdisappears in the product,\u201d and it was based on the experience of homo faber, who knew that a production process necessarily precedes the actual existence of every object.", " Yet while this insistence on the process of making or the insistence upon considering every thing as the result of a fabrication process is highly characteristic of homo faber and his sphere of experience, the exclusive emphasis the modern age placed on it at the expense of all interest in the things, the products themselves, is quite new.", " It actually transcends the mentality of man as a toolmaker and fabricator, for whom, on the contrary, the production process was a mere means to an end.", " Here, from the standpoint of homo faber, it was as though the means, the production process or development, was more important than the end, the finished product.", " The reason for this shift of emphasis is obvious: the scientist made only in order to know, not in order to produce things, and the product was a mere by-product, a side effect.", " Even today all true scientists will agree that the technical applicability of what they are doing is a mere by-product of their endeavor.", " The full significance of this reversal of means and ends remained latent as long as the mechanistic world view, the world view of homo faber par excellence, was predominant.", " This view found its most plausible theory in the famous analogy of the relationship between nature and God with the relationship between the watch and the watchmaker.", " The point in our context is not so much that the eighteenth-century idea of God was obviously formed in the image of homo faber as that in this instance the process character of nature was still limited.", " Although all particular natural things had already been engulfed in the process from which they had come into being, nature as a whole was not yet a process but the more or less stable end product of a divine maker.", " The image of watch and watchmaker is so strikingly apposite precisely because it contains both the notion of a process character of nature in the image of the movements of the watch and the notion of its still intact object character in the image of the watch itself and its maker.", " It is important at this point to remember that the specifically modern suspicion toward man\u2019s truth-receiving capacities, the mistrust of the given, and hence the new confidence in making and introspection which was inspired by the hope that in human consciousness there was a realm where knowing and producing would coincide, did not arise directly from the discovery of the Archimedean point outside the earth in the universe.", " They were, rather, the necessary consequences of this discovery for the discoverer himself, in so far as he was and remained an earth-bound creature.", " This close relationship of the modern mentality with philosophical reflection naturally implies that the victory of homo faber could not remain restricted to the employment of new methods in the natural sciences, the experiment and the mathematization of scientific inquiry.", " One of the most plausible consequences to be drawn from Cartesian doubt was to abandon the attempt to understand nature and generally to know about things not produced by man, and to turn instead exclusively to things that owed their existence to man.", " This kind of argument, in fact, made Vico turn his attention from natural science to history, which he thought to be the only sphere where man could obtain certain knowledge, precisely because he dealt here only with the products of human activity .", " 62 The modern discovery of history and historical consciousness owed one of its greatest impulses neither to a new enthusiasm for the greatness of man, his doings and sufferings, nor to the belief that the meaning of human existence can be found in the story of mankind, but to the 62.", " Vico (op.", " cit.", ", ch.", " 4) states explicitly why he turned away from natural science.", " True knowledge of nature is impossible, because not man but God made it; God can know nature with the same certainty man knows geometry: Geometrica demonstramus quiafacimus; si phy sica demonstrare possemus, facer emus (\u201cWe can prove geometry because we make it; to prove the physical we would have to make it\u201d).", " This little treatise, written more than fifteen years before the first edition of the Scienza Nuova (1725), is interesting in more than one respect.", " Vico criticizes all existing sciences, but not yet for the sake of his new science of history; what he recommends is the study of moral and political science, which he finds unduly neglected.", " It must have been much later that the idea occurred to him that history is made by man as nature is made by God.", " This biographical development, though quite extraordinary in the early eighteenth century, became the rule approximately one hundred years later: each time the modern age had reason to hope for a new political philosophy, it received a philosophy of history instead.", " The Vita Activa and the Modern Age despair of human reason, which

perishability.", " Processes, therefore, and not ideas, the models and shapes of the things to be, become the guide for the making and fabricating activities of homo faber in the modem age.", " Hobbes\u2019s attempt to introduce the new concepts of making and reckoning into political philosophy\u2014 or, rather, his attempt to apply the newly discovered aptitudes of making to the realm of human affairs \u2014 was of the greatest importance; modern rationalism as it is currently known, with the assumed antagonism of reason and passion as its stock-in-trade, has never found a clearer and more uncompromising representative.", " Yet it was precisely the realm of human affairs where the new philosophy was first found wanting, because by its very nature it could not understand or even believe in reality.", " The idea that only what I am going to make will be real \u2014 perfectly true and legitimate in the realm of fabrication \u2014 is forever defeated by the actual course of events, where nothing happens more frequently than the totally unexpected.", " To act in the form of making, to reason in the form of \u201creckoning with consequences,\u201d means to leave out the unexpected, the event itself, since it would be unreasonable or irrational to expect what is no more than an \u201cinfinite improbability.", "\u201d Since, however, the event constitutes the very texture of reality within the realm of human affairs, where the \u201cwholly improbable happens regularly,\u201d it is highly unrealistic not to reckon with it, that is, not to reckon with something with which nobody can safely reckon.", " The political philosophy of the modern age, whose greatest representative is still Hobbes, founders on the perplexity that modern rationalism is unreal and modern realism is irrational \u2014 which is only another way of saying that reality and human reason have parted company.", " Hegel\u2019s gigantic enterprise to reconcile spirit with reality ( den Geist mit der Wirklichkeit zu versohnen ), a reconciliation that is the The Vita Activa and the Modern Age deepest concern of all modern theories of history, rested on the insight that modern reason foundered on the rock of reality.", " The fact that modem world alienation was radical enough to extend even to the most worldly of human activities, to work and reification, the making of things and the building of a world, distinguishes modern attitudes and evaluations even more sharply from those of tradition than a mere reversal of contemplation and action, of thinking and doing, would indicate.", " The break with contemplation was consummated not with the elevation of man the maker to the position formerly held by man the contemplator, but with the introduction of the concept of process into making.", " Compared with this, the striking new arrangement of hierarchical order within the vita activa , where fabrication now came to occupy a rank formerly held by political action, is of minor importance.", " We saw before that this hierarchy had in fact, though not expressly, already been overruled in the very beginnings of political philosophy by the philosophers\u2019 deep-rooted suspicion of politics in general and action in particular.", " The matter is somewhat confused because Greek political philosophy still follows the order laid down by the polis even when it turns against it; but in their strictly philosophical writings (to which, of course, one must turn if he wants to know their innermost thoughts), Plato as well as Aristotle tends to invert the relationship between work and action in favor of work.", " Thus Aristotle, in a discussion of the different kinds of cognition in his Metaphysics , places dianoia and episteme praktike, practical insight and political science, at the lowest rank of his order, and puts above them the science of fabrication, episteme poietike, which immediately precedes and leads to thedria, the contemplation of truth .", " 66 And the reason for this predilection in philosophy is by no means the politically inspired suspicion of action which we mentioned before, but the philosophically much more compelling one that contemplation and fabrication ( thedria and poiesis ) have an inner affinity and do not stand in the same unequivocal opposition to each other as contemplation and action.", " The decisive point of similarity, at least in Greek philosophy, was that contemplation, the beholding of something, was considered to be an inherent ele66.", " Metaphysics 1025b25 ff.", ", 1064al7 ff.", " ment in fabrication as well, inasmuch as the work of the craftsman was guided by the \u201cidea,\u201d the model beheld by him before the fabrication process had started as well as after it had ended, first to tell him what to make and then to enable him to judge the finished product.", " Historically, the source of this contemplation, which we find for the first time described in the Socratic school, is at least twofold.", " On one hand, it stands in obvious and consistent connection with the famous contention of Plato, quoted by Aristotle, that thaumazein, the shocked wonder at the miracle of Being, is the beginning of all philosophy .", " 67 It seems to me highly probable that this Platonic contention is the immediate result of an experience, perhaps the most striking one, that Socrates offered his disciples: the sight of him time and again suddenly overcome by his thoughts and thrown into a state of absorption to the point of perfect motionlessness for many hours.", " It seems no less plausible that this shocked wonder should be essentially speechless, that is, that its actual content should be untranslatable into words.", " This, at least, would explain why Plato and Aristotle, who held thaumazein to be the beginning of philosophy, should also agree \u2014 despite so many and such decisive disagreements \u2014 that some state of speechlessness, the essentially speechless state of contemplation, was the end of philosophy.", " Thedria, in fact, is only another word for thaumazein; the contemplation of truth at which the philosopher ultimately arrives is the philosophically purified speechless wonder with which he began.", " There is, however, another side to this matter, which shows itself most articulately in Plato\u2019s doctrine of ideas, in its content as well as in its terminology and exemplifications.", " These reside in the experiences of the craftsman, who sees before his inner eye the shape of the model according to which he fabricates his object.", " To 67.", " For Plato see Theaetetus 155: Mala gar philosophm touto to pathos, to thaumazein ; ou gar alle archie philosophias e haute (\u201cFor wonder is what the philosopher endures most; for there is no other beginning of philosophy than this\u201d).", " Aristotle, who at the beginning of the Metaphysics (982bl2 IF.", ") seems to repeat Plato almost verbatim \u2014 \u201cFor it is owing to their wonder that men both now begin and at first began to philosophize\u201d \u2014 actually uses this wonder in an altogether different way; to him, the actual impulse to philosophize lies in the desire \u201cto escape ignorance.", "\u201d The Vita Activa and the Modern Age Plato, this model, which craftsmanship can only imitate but not create, is no product of the human mind but given to it.", " As such it possesses a degree of permanence and excellence which is not actualized but on the contrary spoiled in its materialization through the work of human hands.", " Work makes perishable and spoils the excellence of what remained eternal so long as it was the object of mere contemplation.", " Therefore, the proper attitude toward the models which guide work and fabrication, that is, toward Platonic ideas, is to leave them as they are and appear to the inner eye of the mind.", " If man only renounces his capacity for work and does not do anything, he can behold them and thus participate in their eternity.", " Contemplation, in this respect, is quite unlike the enraptured state of wonder with which man responds to the miracle of Being as a whole.", " It is and remains part and parcel of a fabrication process even though it has divorced itself from all work and all doing; in it, the beholding of the model, which now no longer is to guide any doing, is prolonged and enjoyed for its own sake.", " In the tradition of philosophy, it is this second kind of contemplation that became the predominant one.", " Therefore the motionlessness which in the state of speechless wonder is no more than an incidental, unintended result of absorption, becomes now the condition and hence the outstanding characteristic of the vita contemplativa.", " It is not wonder that overcomes and throws man into motionlessness, but it is through the conscious cessation of activity, the activity of making, that the contemplative state is reached.", " If one reads medieval sources on the joys and delights of contemplation, it is as though the philosophers wanted to make sure that homo faber would heed the call and let his arms drop, finally realizing that his greatest desire, the desire for permanence and immortality, cannot be fulfilled by his doings, but only when he realizes that the beautiful and eternal cannot be made.", " In Plato\u2019s philosophy, speechless wonder, the beginning and the end of philosophy, together with the philosopher\u2019s love for the eternal and the craftsman\u2019s desire for permanence and immortality, permeate each other until they are almost indistinguishable.", " Yet the very fact that the philosophers\u2019 speechless wonder seemed to be an experience reserved for the few, while the craftsmen\u2019s contemplative glance was known by many, weighed heavily in favor of a contemplation primarily derived from the experiences of homo faber.", " It already weighed heavily with Plato, who drew his examples from the realm of making because they were closer to a more general human experience, and it weighed even more heavily where some kind of contemplation and meditation was required of everybody, as in medieval Christianity.", " Thus it was not primarily the philosopher and philosophic speechless wonder that molded the concept and practice of contemplation and the vita contemplative but rather homo faber in disguise; it was man the maker and fabricator, whose job it is to do violence to nature in order to build a permanent home for himself, and who now was persuaded to renounce violence together with all activity, to leave things as they are, and to find his home in the contemplative dwelling in the neighborhood of the imperishable and eternal.", " Homo faber could be persuaded to this change of attitude because he knew contemplation and some of its delights from his own experience; he did not need a complete change of heart, a true periagoge, a radical turnabout.", " All he had to do was let his arms drop and prolong indefinitely the act of beholding the eidos, the eternal shape and model he had formerly wanted to imitate and whose excellence and beauty he now knew he could only spoil through any attempt at reification.", " If, therefore, the modern challenge to the priority of contemplation over every kind of activity had done no more than turn upside down the established order between making and beholding, it would still have remained in the traditional framework.", " This framework was forced wide open, however, when in the understanding of fabrication itself the emphasis shifted entirely away from the product and from the permanent, guiding model to the fabrication process, away from the question of what a thing is and what kind of thing was to be produced to the question of how and through which means and processes it had come into being and could be reproduced.", " For this implied both that contemplation was no longer believed to yield truth and that it had lost its position in the vita activa itself and hence within the range of ordinary human experience.", " The Vita Activa and the Modern Age 43 the defeat of Homo Faber and the PRINCIPLE OF HAPPINESS If one considers only the events that led into the modern age and reflects solely upon the immediate consequences of Galileo\u2019s discovery, which must have struck the great minds of the seventeenth century with the compelling force of self-evident truth, the reversal of contemplation and fabrication, or rather the elimination of contemplation from the range of meaningful human capacities, is almost a matter of course.", " It seems equally plausible that this reversal should have elevated homojaber , the maker and fabricator, rather than man the actor or man as animal laborans, to the highest range of human possibilities.", " And, indeed, among the outstanding characteristics of the modern age from its beginning to our own time we find the typical attitudes of homo faber: his instrumentalization of the world, his confidence in tools and in the productivity of the maker of artificial objects; his trust in the all-comprehensive range of the means-end category, his conviction that every issue can be solved and every human motivation reduced to the principle of utility; his sovereignty, which regards everything given as material and thinks of the whole of nature as of \u201can immense fabric from which we can cut out whatever we want to resew it however we like \u201d; 68 his equation of intelligence with ingenuity, that is, his contempt for all 68.", " Henri Bergson, Evolution creatrice (1948), p.", " 157.", " An analysis of Bergson\u2019s position in modern philosophy would lead us too far afield.", " But his insistence on the priority of homo faber over homo sapiens and on fabrication as the source of human intelligence, as well as his emphatic opposition of life to intelligence, is very suggestive.", " Bergson\u2019s philosophy could easily be read like a case study of how the modern age\u2019s earlier conviction of the relative superiority of making over thinking was then superseded and annihilated by its more recent conviction of an absolute superiority of life over everything else.", " It is because Bergson himself still united both of these elements that he could exert such a decisive influence on the beginnings of labor theories in

predilection for patterns for things to be produced replaces the older notions of harmony and simplicity.", " It can be found in classical economics, whose highest standard is productivity and whose prejudice against non-productive activities is so strong that even Marx could justify his plea for justice for laborers only by misrepresenting the laboring, non-productive activity in terms of work and fabrication.", " It is most articulate, of course, in the pragmatic trends of modern philosophy, which are not only characterized by Cartesian world alienation but also by the unanimity with which English philosophy from the seventeenth century onward and French philosophy in the eighteenth century adopted the principle of utility as the key which would open all doors to the explanation of human motivation and behavior.", " Generally speaking, the oldest conviction of hmno faber \u2014 that \u201cman is the measure of all things\u201d \u2014 advanced to the rank of a universally accepted commonplace.", " What needs explanation is not the modern esteem of homo faber but the fact that this esteem was so quickly followed by the elevation of laboring to the highest position in the hierarchical order of the vita activa.", " This second reversal of hierarchy within the vita activa came about more gradually and less dramatically than either the reversal of contemplation and action in general or the reversal of action and fabrication in particular.", " The elevation of laboring was preceded by certain deviations and variations from the traditional mentality of homo faber

deprived man as maker and builder of those fixed and permanent standards and measurements which, prior to the modern age, have always served him as guides for his doing and criteria for his judgment.", " It is not only and perhaps not even primarily the development of commercial society that, with the triumphal victory of exchange value over use value, first introduced the principle of interchangeability, then the relativization, and finally the devaluation, of all values.", " For the mentality of modern man, as it was determined by the development of modern science and the concomitant unfolding of modern philosophy, it was at least as decisive that man began to consider himself part and parcel of the two superhuman, all-encompassing processes of nature and history, both of which seemed doomed to an infinite progress without ever reaching any inherent telos or approaching any preordained idea.", " Homo faber, in other words, as he arose from the great revolution of modernity, though he was to acquire an undreamed-of ingenuity in devising instruments to measure the infinitely large and the infinitely small, was deprived of those permanent measures that precede and outlast the fabrication process and form an authentic and reliable absolute with respect to the fabricating activity.", " Certainly, none of the activities of the vita activa stood to lose as much through the elimination of contemplation from the range of meaningful human capacities as fabrication.", " For unlike action, which partly consists in the unchaining of processes, and unlike laboring, which follows closely the metabolic process of biological life, fabrication experiences processes, if it is aware of them at all, as mere means toward an end, that is, as something secondary and derivative.", " No other capacity, moreover, stood to lose as much through modern world alienation and the elevation of introspection into an omnipotent device to conquer nature as those faculties which are primarily directed toward the building of the world and the production of worldly things.", " Nothing perhaps indicates clearer the ultimate failure of homo faber to assert himself than the rapidity with which the principle of utility, the very quintessence of his world view, was found wanting and was superseded by the principle of \u201cthe greatest happiness of the greatest number .", "\u201d 71 When this happened it was manifest that the conviction of the age that man can know only what he makes himself \u2014 which seemingly was so eminently propitious to a full victory of homo

that the utility principle had been related primarily to the ego prior to Bentham, it is only Bentham who radically emptied the idea of utility of all reference to an independent world of use things

not as the maker of objects and the builder of the human artifice who incidentally invents tools, but considers himself primarily a toolmaker and \u201cparticularly [a maker] of tools to make tools\u201d who only incidentally also produces things.", " If one applies the principle of utility in this context at all, then it refers primarily not to use objects and not to usage but to the production process.", " Now what helps stimulate productivity and lessens pain and effort is useful.", " In other words, the ultimate standard of measurement is not utility and usage at all, but \u201chappiness,\u201d that is, the amount of pain and pleasure experienced in the production or in the consumption of things.", " Bentham\u2019s invention of the \u201cpain and pleasure

introspection.", " His \u201chappiness,\u201d the sum total of pleasures minus pains, is as much an inner sense which senses sensations and remains unrelated to worldly objects as the Cartesian consciousness that is conscious of its own activity.", " Moreover, Bentham\u2019s basic assumption that what all men have in common is not the world but the sameness of their own nature, which manifests itself in the sameness of calculation and the sameness of being affected by pain and pleasure, is directly derived from the earlier philosophers of the modern age.", " For this philosophy, \u201chedonism\u201d is even more of a misnomer than for the epicureanism of late antiquity, to which modern hedonism is only superficially related.", " The principle of all hedonism, as we saw before, is not pleasure but avoidance of pain, and Hume, who in contradistinction to Bentham was still a philosopher, knew quite well that he who wants to make pleasure the ultimate end of all human action is driven to admit that not pleasure but pain, not desire but fear, are his true guides.", " \u201cIf you .", " .", " .", " inquire, why is painful.", " If you push your inquiries further and

that only pain is completely inde73.", " Quoted from Halevy, op.", " cit.", ", p.", " 13.", " pendent of any object, that only one who is in pain really senses nothing but himself; pleasure does not enjoy itself but something besides itself.", " Pain is the only inner sense found by introspection which can rival in independence from experienced objects the selfevident certainty of logical and arithmetical reasoning.", " While this ultimate foundation of hedonism in the experience of pain is true for both its ancient and modern varieties, in the modern age it acquires an altogether different and much stronger emphasis.", " For here it is by no means the world, as in antiquity, that drives man into himself to escape the pains it may inflict, under which circumstance both pain and pleasure still retain a good deal of their worldly significance.", " Ancient world alienation in all its varieties \u2014 from stoicism to epicureanism down to hedonism and cynicism \u2014 had been inspired by a deep mistrust of the world and moved by a vehement impulse to withdraw from worldly involvement, from the trouble and pain it inflicts, into the security of an inward realm in which the self is exposed to nothing but itself.", " Their moderr counterparts \u2014 puritanism, sensualism, and Bentham\u2019s hedonism \u2014 on the contrary, were inspired by an equally deep mistrust of man as such; they were moved by doubt of the adequacy of the human senses to receive reality, the adequacy of human reason to receive truth, and hence by the conviction of the deficiency or even depravity of human nature.", " This depravity is not Christian or biblical either in origin or in content, although it was of course interpreted in terms of original sin, and it is difficult to say whether it is more harmful and repulsive when puritans denounce man\u2019s corruptness or when Benthamites brazenly hail as virtues what men always have known to be vices.", " While the ancients had relied upon imagination and memory, the imagination of pains from which they were free or the memory of past pleasures in situations of acute painfulness, to convince themselves of their happiness, the moderns needed the calculus of pleasure or the puritan moral bookkeeping of merits and transgressions to arrive at some illusory mathematical certainty of happiness or salvation.", " (These moral arithmetics are, of course, quite alien to the spirit pervading the philosophic schools of late antiquity.", " Moreover, one need only reflect on the rigidity of self-imposed discipline and the concomitant nobility of character, so manifest in The Vita Activa and the Modern Age those who had been formed by ancient stoicism or epicureanism, to become aware of the gulf by which these versions of hedonism are separated from modern puritanism, sensualism, and hedonism.", " For this difference, it is almost irrelevant whether the modern character is still formed by the older narrow-minded, fanatic self-righteousness or has yielded to the more recent self-centered and selfindulgent egotism with its infinite variety of futile miseries.", ") It seems more than doubtful that the \u201cgreatest happiness principle\u201d would have achieved its intellectual triumphs in the English-speaking world if no more had been involved than the questionable discovery that \u201cnature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure,\u201d 74 or the absurd idea of establishing morals as an exact science by isolating \u201cin the human soul that feeling which seems to be the most easily measurable.", "\u201d 76 Hidden behind this as behind other, less interesting variations of the sacredness of egoism and the all-pervasive power of self-interest, which were current to the point of being commonplace in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, we find another point of reference which indeed forms a much more potent principle than any pain-pleasure calculus could ever offer, and that is the principle of life itself.", " What pain and pleasure, fear and desire, are actually supposed to achieve in all these systems is not happiness at all but the promotion of individual life or a guaranty of the survival of mankind.", " If modem egoism were the ruthless search for pleasure (called happiness) it pretends to be, it would not lack what in all truly hedonistic systems is an indispensable element of argumentation \u2014 a radical justification of suicide.", " This lack alone indicates that in fact we deal here with life philosophy in its most vulgar and least critical form.", " In the last resort, it is always life itself which is the supreme standard to which everything else is referred, and the 74.", " This, of course, is the first

without copying from each other.", " 75.", " Ibid.", ", p.", " 15.", " interests of the individual as well as the interests of mankind are always equated with individual life or the life of the species as though it were a matter of course that life is the highest good.", " The curious failure of homo faber to assert himself under conditions seemingly so extraordinarily propitious could also have been illustrated by another, philosophically even more relevant, revision of basic traditional beliefs.", " Hume\u2019s radical criticism of the causality principle, which prepared the way for the later adoption of the principle of evolution, has often been considered one of the origins of modern philosophy.", " The causality principle with its twofold central axiom \u2014 that everything that is must have a cause ( nihil sine causa) and that the cause must be more perfect than its most perfect effect \u2014 obviously relies entirely on experiences in the realm of fabrication, where the maker is superior to his products.", " Seen in this context, the turning point in the intellectual history of the modern age came when the image of organic life development\u2014 where the evolution of a lower being, for instance the ape, can cause the appearance of a higher being, for instance man \u2014 appeared in the place of the image of the watchmaker who must be superior to all watches whose cause he is.", " Much more is implied in this change than the mere denial of the lifeless rigidity of a mechanistic world view.", " It is as though in the latent seventeenth-century conflict between the two possible methods to be derived from the Galilean discovery, the method of the experiment and of making on one hand and the method of introspection on the other, the latter was to achieve a somewhat belated victory.", " For the only tangible object introspection yields, if it is to yield more than an entirely empty consciousness of itself, is indeed the biological process.", " And since this biological life, accessible in self-observation, is at the same time a metabolic process between man and nature, it is as though introspection no longer needs to get lost in the ramifications of a consciousness without reality, but has found within man \u2014 not in his mind but in his bodily processes \u2014 enough outside matter to connect him again with the outer world.", " The split between subject and object, inherent in human consciousness and irremediable in the Cartesian opposition of man as a res cogitans to a surrounding world of res extensae, disappears altogether in the case of a living organism, whose very survival depends upon The Vita Activa and the Modern Age the incorporation, the consumption, of outside matter.", " Naturalism, the nineteenth-century version of materialism, seemed to find in life the way to solve the problems of Cartesian philosophy and at the same time to bridge the ever-widening chasm between philosophy and science .", " 76 44 LIFE AS THE HIGHEST GOOD Tempting as it may be for the sake of sheer consistency to derive the modern life concept from the self-inflicted perplexities of modern philosophy, it would be a delusion and a grave injustice to the seriousness of the problems of the modern age if one looked upon them merely from the viewpoint of the development of ideas.", " The defeat of homo faber may be explainable in terms of the initial transformation of physics into astrophysics, of natural sciences into a \u201cuniversal\u201d science.", " What still remains to be explained is why this defeat ended with a victory of the animal laborans; why, with the rise of the vita activa, it was precisely the laboring activity that was to be elevated to the highest rank of man\u2019s capacities or, to put it another way, why within the diversity of the human condition with its various human capacities it was precisely life that overruled all other considerations.", " The reason why life asserted itself as the ultimate point of reference in the modern age and has remained the highest good of mod76.", " The greatest representatives of modem life philosophy are Marx, Nietzsche, and Bergson, inasmuch as all three equate Life and Being.", " For this equation, they rely on introspection, and life is indeed the only \u201cbeing\u201d man can possibly be aware of by looking merely into himself.", " The difference between these and the earlier philosophers of the modern age is that life appears to be more active and more productive than consciousness, which seems to be still too closely related to contemplation and the old ideal of truth.", " This last stage of modem philosophy is perhaps best described as the rebellion of the philosophers against philosophy, a rebellion which, beginning with Kierkegaard and ending in existentialism, appears at first glance to emphasize action as against contemplation.", " Upon closer inspection, however, none of these philosophers is actually concerned with action as such.", " We may leave aside here Kierkegaard and his non-worldly, inward-directed acting.", " Nietzsche and Bergson describe action in terms of fabrication \u2014homo faber instead of homo sapiens \u2014 just as Marx thinks of acting in terms of making and describes labor in terms of work.", " But their ultimate point of reference is not work and worldliness any more than action; it is life and life\u2019s fertility.", " ern society is that the modern reversal operated within the fabric of a Christian society whose fundamental belief in the sacredness of life has survived, and has even remained completely unshaken by, secularization and the general decline of the Christian faith.", " In other words, the modern reversal followed and left unchallenged the most important reversal with which Christianity had broken into the ancient world, a reversal that was politically even more far-reaching and, historically at any rate, more enduring than any specific dogmatic content or belief.", " For the Christian \u201cglad tidings\u201d of the immortality of individual human life had reversed the ancient relationship between man and world and promoted the most mortal thing, human life, to the position of immortality, which up to then the cosmos had held.", " Historically, it is more than probable that the victory of the Christian faith in the ancient world was largely due to this reversal, which brought hope to those who knew that their world was doomed, indeed a hope beyond hope, since the new message promised an immortality they never had dared to hope for.", " This reversal could not but be disastrous for the esteem and the dignity of politics.", " Political activity, which up to then had derived its greatest inspiration from the aspiration toward worldly immortality, now sank to the low level of an activity subject to necessity, destined to remedy the consequences of human sinfulness on one hand and to cater to the legitimate wants and interests of earthly life on the other.", " Aspiration toward immortality could now only be equated with vainglory; such fame as the world could bestow upon man was an illusion, since the world was even more perishable than man, and a striving for worldly immortality was meaningless, since life itself was immortal.", " It is precisely individual life which now came to occupy the position once held by the \u201clife\u201d of the body politic, and Paul\u2019s statement that \u201cdeath is the wages of sin,\u201d since life is meant to last forever, echoes Cicero\u2019s statement that death is the reward of sins committed by political communities which were built to last for eternity .", " 77 It is as though the early Christians \u2014 at least Paul, 77.", " Cicero\u2019s remark: Civitatibus autem mors ipsa poena est .", " .", " .", " debet enim constituta sic esse civitas utaeterna sit ( De republica iii.", " 23) .", " For the conviction in antiquity that a well-founded body politic should be immortal, see also Plato, Laws 713, The Vita Activa and the Modern Age who after all was a Roman citizen \u2014 consciously shaped their concept of immortality after the Roman model, substituting individual life for the political life of the body politic.", " Just as the body politic possesses only a potential immortality which can be forfeited by political transgressions, individual life had once forfeited its guaranteed immortality in Adam\u2019s fall and now, through Christ, had regained a new, potentially everlasting life which, however, could again be lost in a second death through individual sin.", " Certainly, Christian emphasis on the sacredness of life is part and parcel of the Hebrew heritage, which already presented a striking contrast to the attitudes of antiquity: the pagan contempt for the hardships which life imposes upon man in labor and giving birth, the envious picture of the \u201ceasy life\u201d of the gods, the custom of exposing unwanted offspring, the conviction that life without health is not worth living (so that the physician, for instance, is held to have misunderstood his calling when he prolongs life where he cannot restore health ) 78 and that suicide is a noble gesture to escape a life that has become burdensome.", " Still, one need only remember how the Decalogue enumerates the offense of murder, without any special emphasis, among a number of other transgressions \u2014 which to our way of thinking can hardly compete in gravity with this supreme crime \u2014 to realize that not even the Hebrew legal code, though much closer to our own than any pagan scale of offenses, made the preservation of life the cornerstone of the legal system of the Jewish people.", " This intermediary position which the Hebrew legal code occupies between pagan antiquity and all Christian or post-Christian legal systems may be explicable by the Hebrew creed which stresses the potential immortality of the people, as distinguished from the pagan immortality of the world on one side and the Christian immortality of individual life on the other.", " At any event, this Christian immortality that is bestowed upon the person, who in his uniqueness begins life by birth on earth, resulted not only in the more obvious increase of otherworldliness, but also in an enormously increased importance of life where the founders of a new polis are told to imitate the immortal part in man (hoson en hemin athanasias enest ) .", " 78.", " See Plato Republic 405C.", " on earth.", " The point is that Christianity \u2014 except for heretical and gnostic speculations \u2014 always insisted that life, though it had no longer a final end, still has a definite beginning.", " Life on earth may be only the first and the most miserable stage of eternal life; it still is life, and without this life that will be terminated in death, there cannot be eternal life.", " This may be the reason for the undisputable fact that only when the immortality of individual life became the central creed of Western mankind, that is, only with the rise of Christianity, did life on earth also become the highest good of man.", " Christian emphasis on the sacredness of life tended to level out the ancient distinctions and articulations within the vita activa; it tended to view labor, work, and action as equally subject to the necessity of present life.", " At the same time it helped to free the laboring activity, that is, whatever is necessary to sustain the biological process itself, from some of the contempt in which antiquity had held it.", " The old contempt toward the slave, who had been despised because he served only life\u2019s necessities and submitted to the compulsion of his master because he wanted to stay alive at all costs, could not possibly survive in the Christian era.", " One could no longer with Plato despise the slave for not having committed suicide rather than submit to a master, for to stay alive under all circumstances had become a holy duty, and suicide was regarded as worse than murder.", " Not the murderer, but he who had put an end to his own life was refused a Christian burial.", " Yet contrary to what some modern interpreters have tried to read into Christian sources, there are no indications of the modern glorification of laboring in the New Testament or in other premodern Christian writers.", " Paul, who has been called \u201cthe apostle of labor ,\u201d 79 was nothing of the sort, and the few passages on which 79.", " By the Dominican Bernard Alio, Le travail d\u2019apres St.", " Paul (1914) .", " Among the defenders of the Christian origin of modern glorification of labor are: in France, fitienne Borne and Francois Henry, Le travail et I'homme (1937); in Germany, Karl Muller, Die Arbeit: Nach moral-philosophischen Grundsdtzen des heiligen Thomas van Aquino (1912).", " More recently, Jacques Leclercq from Louvain, who has contributed one of the most valuable and interesting works to the philosophy of labor in the fourth book of his Lefons de droit naturel, entitled Travail, propriete (1946), has rectified this misinterpretation of the Christian sources: \u201cLe christianisme n\u2019a pas change grand\u2019chose a l\u2019estime du travail\u201d; The Vita Activa and the Modern Age this claim is based either are addressed to those who out of laziness \u201cate other men\u2019s bread\u201d or they recommend labor as a good means to keep out of trouble, that is, they reinforce the general prescription of a strictly private life and warn of political activities .", " 80 It is even more relevant that in later Christian philosophy, and particularly in Thomas Aquinas, labor had become a duty for those who had no other means to keep alive, the duty consisting in keeping one\u2019s self alive and not in laboring; if one could provide for himself through beggary, so much the better.", " Whoever reads the sources without modern prolabor prejudices will be surprised at how little the church fathers availed themselves even of the obvious opportunity to justify labor as punishment for original sin.", " Thus Thomas does not hesitate to follow Aristotle rather than the Bible in this question and to assert that \u201conly the necessity to keep alive compels to do manual labor .", "\u201d 81 Labor to him is nature\u2019s way of keeping the human species alive, and from this he concludes that it is by no means necessary that all men earn their bread by the sweat of their brows, but that this is rather a kind of last and desperate resort to solve the problem or fulfil the duty .", " 82 Not even the use of labor as a means with which to ward off the dangers of otiosity is a new Christian discovery, but was already a commonplace of Roman morality.", " In complete agreement with ancient convictions about the character of the laboring activity, finally, is the frequent Christian use for the mortification of the flesh, where labor, especially in the monasteries, sometimes played the same role as other painful exercises and forms of self-torture .", " 83 and in Aquinas\u2019 work

the sacredness of life and on the duty to stay alive notwithstanding, never developed a positive labor philosophy lies in the unquestioned priority given to the vita contemplativa over all kinds of human activities.", " Vita contemplativct simpliciter melior est quam vita activa (\u201cthe life of contemplation is simply better than the life of action\u201d), and whatever the merits of an active life might be, those of a life devoted to contemplation are \u201cmore effective and more powerful .", "\u201d 84 This conviction, it is true, can hardly be found in the preachings of Jesus of Nazareth, and it is certainly due to the influence of Greek philosophy; yet even if medieval philosophy had kept closer to the spirit of the Gospels, it could hardly have found there any reason for a glorification of laboring .", " 86 The only activity Jesus of Nazareth recommends in his preachings is action, and the only human capacity he stresses is the capacity \u201cto perform miracles.", "\u201d However that may be, the modern age continued to operate under the assumption that life, and not the world, is the highest good of man; in its boldest and most radical revisions and criticisms of traditional beliefs and concepts, it never even thought of challenging this fundamental reversal which Christianity had brought into reasons: it helps to fight the temptations of otiosity; it helps the monasteries to fulfil their duty of charity toward the poor; and it is favorable to contemplation because it does not engage the mind unduly like other occupations, for instance, the buying and selling of goods.", " For the role of labor in the monasteries, compare Etienne Delaruelle, \u201cLe travail dans les regies monastiques occidentales du 4e au 9e siecle,\u201d Journal de psychologic

behind and to substitute for a laboring society the society of jobholders.", " But while it is quite conceivable that the development following upon the discovery of the Archimedean point would have taken an altogether different direction if it had taken place seventeen hundred years earlier, when not life but the world was still the highest good of man, it by no means follows that we still live in a Christian world.", " For what matters today is not the immortality of life, but that life is the highest good.", " And while this assumption certainly is Christian in origin, it constitutes no more than an important attending circumstance for the Christian faith.", " Moreover, even if we disregard the details of Christian dogma and consider only the general mood of Christianity, which resides in the importance of faith, it is obvious that nothing could be more detrimental to this spirit than the spirit of distrust and suspicion of the modern age.", " Surely, Cartesian doubt has proved its efficiency nowhere more disastrously and irretrievably than in the realm of religious belief, where it was introduced by Pascal and Kierkegaard, the two greatest religious thinkers of modernity.", " (For what undermined the Christian faith was not the atheism of the eighteenth century or the materialism of the nineteenth \u2014 their arguments are frequently vulgar and, for the most part, easily refutable by traditional theology \u2014 but rather the doubting concern with salvation of genuinely religious men, in whose eyes the traditional Christian content and promise had become \u201cabsurd.", "\u201d) Just as we do not know what would have happened if the Archimedean point had been discovered before the rise of Christianity, we are in no position to ascertain what the destiny of Christianity would have been if the great awakening of the Renaissance had not been interrupted by this event.", " Before Galileo, all paths still seemed to be open.", " If we think back to Leonardo, we may well imagine that a technical revolution would have overtaken the development of humanity in any case.", " This might well have led to flight, the realization of one of the oldest and most persistent dreams of man, but it hardly would have led into the universe; it might well have brought about the unification of the earth, but it hardly would have brought about the transformation of matter into energy and the adventure into the microscopic universe.", " The only thing we can be sure of is that the coincidence of the reversal of doing and contemplating with the earlier reversal of life and world became the point of departure for the whole modern development.", " Only when the vita activa had lost its point of reference in the vita contemplativa could it become active life in the full sense of the word; and only because this active life remained bound to life as its only point of reference could life as such, the laboring metabolism of man with nature, become active and unfold its entire fertility.", " 45 the victory of the Animal Lab or an s The victory of the animal laborans would never have been complete had not the process of secularization, the modern loss of faith inevitably arising from Cartesian doubt, deprived individual life of its immortality, or at least of the certainty of immortality.", " Individual life again became mortal, as mortal as it had been in antiquity, and the world was even less stable, less permanent, and hence less to be relied upon than it had been during the Christian era.", " Modern man, when he lost the certainty of a world to come, was thrown back upon himself and not upon this world; far from believing that the world might be potentially immortal, he was not even sure that it was real.", " And in so far as he was to assume that it was real in the uncritical and apparently unbothered optimism of a steadily progressing science, he had removed himself from the earth to a much more distant point than any Christian otherworldliness had ever removed him.", " Whatever the word \u201csecular\u201d is meant to signify in current usage, historically it cannot possibly be equated with worldliness; modern man at any rate did not gain this world when he lost the other world, and he did not gain life, strictly speaking, either; he was thrust back upon it, thrown into the closed inwardness of introspection, where the highest he could experience were the empty processes of reckoning of the mind, its play with itself.", " The only contents left were appetites and desires, the senseless The Vita Activa and the Modern Age urges of his body which he mistook for passion and which he deemed to be \u201cunreasonable\u201d because he found he could not \u201creason,\u201d that is, not reckon with them.", " The only thing that could now be potentially immortal, as immortal as the body politic in antiquity and as individual life during the Middle Ages, was life itself, that is, the possibly everlasting life process of the species mankind.", " We saw before that in the rise of society it was ultimately the life of the species which asserted itself.", " Theoretically, the turning point from the earlier modem age\u2019s insistence on the \u201cegoistic\u201d life of the individual to its later emphasis on \u201csocial\u201d life and \u201csocialized man\u201d (Marx) came when Marx transformed the cruder notion of classical economy \u2014 that all men, in so far as they act at all, act for reasons of self-interest \u2014 into forces of interest which inform, move, and direct the classes of society, and through their conflicts direct society as a whole.", " Socialized mankind is that state of society where only one interest rules, and the subject of this interest is either classes or man-kind, but neither man nor men.", " The point is that now even the last trace of action in what men were doing, the motive implied in self-interest, disappeared.", " What was left was a \u201cnatural force,\u201d the force of the life process itself, to which all men and all human activities were equally submitted (\u201cthe thought process itself is a natural process\u201d) S6 and whose only aim, if it had an aim at all, was survival of the animal species man.", " None of the higher capacities of man was any longer necessary to connect individual life with the life of the species; individual life became part of the life process, and to labor, to assure the continuity of one\u2019s own life and the life of his family, was all that was needed.", " What was not needed, not necessitated by life\u2019s metabolism with nature, was either superfluous or could be justified only in terms of a peculiarity of human as distinguished from other animal life-\u2014 so that Milton was considered to have written his Paradise Lost for the same reasons and out of similar urges that compel the silkworm to produce silk.", " If we compare the modern world with that of the past, the loss ot human experience involved in this development is extraordinarily striking.", " It is not only and not even primarily contemplation which 86.", " In a letter Marx wrote to Kugelmann in July, 1868.", " has become an entirely meaningless experience.", " Thought itself, when it became \u201creckoning with consequences,\u201d became a function of the brain, with the result that electronic instruments are found to fulfil these functions much better than we ever could.", " Action was soon and still is almost exclusively understood in terms of making and fabricating, only that making, because of its worldliness and inherent indifference to life, was now regarded as but another form of laboring, a more complicated but not a more mysterious function of the life process.", " Meanwhile, we have proved ingenious enough to find ways to ease the toil and trouble of living to the point where an elimination of laboring from the range of human activities can no longer be regarded as utopian.", " For even now, laboring is too lofty, too ambitious a word for what we are doing, or think we are doing, in the world we have come to live in.", " The last stage of the laboring society, the society of jobholders, demands of its members a sheer automatic functioning, as though individual life had actually been submerged in the over-all life process of the species and the only active decision still required of the individual were to let go, so to speak, to abandon his individuality, the still individually sensed pain and trouble of living, and acquiesce in a dazed, \u201ctranquilized,\u201d functional type of behavior.", " The trouble with modern theories of behaviorism is not that they are wrong but that they could become true, that they actually are the best possible conceptualization of certain obvious trends in modern society.", " It is quite conceivable that the modern age \u2014 which began with such an unprecedented and promising outburst of human activity \u2014 may end in the deadliest, most sterile passivity history has ever known.", " But there are other more serious danger signs that man may be willing and, indeed, is on the point of developing into that animal species from which, since Darwin, he imagines he has come.", " If, in concluding, we return once more to the discovery of the Archimedean point and apply it, as Kafka warned us not to do, to man himself and to what he is doing on this earth, it at once becomes manifest that all his activities, watched from a sufficiently removed vantage point in the universe, would appear not as activities of any kind but as processes, so that, as a scientist recently put it, modem motorization would appear like a process of biological mutation in The Vita Activa and the Modern Age which human bodies gradually begin to be covered by shells of steel.", " For the watcher from the universe, this mutation would be no more or less mysterious than the mutation which now goes on before our eyes in those small living organisms which we fought with antibiotics and which mysteriously have developed new strains to resist us.", " How deep-rooted this usage of the Archimedean point against ourselves is can be seen in the very metaphors which dominate scientific thought today.", " The reason why scientists can tell us about the \u201clife\u201d in the atom\u2014 where apparently every particle is \u201cfree\u201d to behave as it wants and the laws ruling these movements are the same statistical laws which, according to the social scientists, rule human behavior and make the multitude behave as it must, no matter how \u201cfree\u201d the individual particle may appear to be in its choices\u2014 the reason, in other words, why the behavior of the infinitely small particle is not only similar in pattern to the planetary system as it appears to us but resembles the life and behavior patterns in human society is, of course, that we look and live in this society as though we were as far removed from our own human existence as we are from the infinitely small and the immensely large which, even if they could be perceived by the finest instruments, are too far away from us to be experienced.", " Needless to say, this does not mean that modern man has lost his capacities or is on the point of losing them.", " No matter what sociology, psychology, and anthropology will tell us about the \u201csocial animal,\u201d men persist in making, fabricating, and building, although these faculties are more and more restricted to the abilities of the artist, so that the concomitant experiences of worldliness escape more and more the range of ordinary human experience .", " 87 Similarly, the capacity for action, at least in the sense of the releasing of processes, is still with us, although it has become the exclusive prerogative of the scientists, who have enlarged the 87.", " This inherent worldliness of the artist is of course not changed if a \u201cnonobjective art\u201d replaces the representation of things; to mistake this \u201cnon-objectivity\u201d for subjectivity, where the artist feels called upon to \u201cexpress himself,\u201d his subjective feelings, is the mark of charlatans, not of artists.", " The artist, whether painter or sculptor or poet or musician, produces worldly objects, and his reification has nothing in common with the highly questionable and, at any rate, wholly unartistic practice of expression.", " Expressionist art, but not abstract art, is a contradiction in terms.", " realm of human affairs to the point of extinguishing the timehonored protective dividing line between nature and the human world.", " In view of such achievements, performed for centuries in the unseen quiet of the laboratories, it seems only proper that their deeds should eventually have turned out to have greater news value, to be of greater political significance, than the administrative and diplomatic doings of most so-called statesmen.", " It certainly is not without irony that those whom public opinion has persistently held to be the least practical and the least political members of society should have turned out to be the only ones left who still know how to act and how to act in concert.", " For their early organizations, which they founded in the seventeenth century for the conquest of nature and in which they developed their own moral standards and their own code of honor, have not only survived all vicissitudes of the modern age, but they have become one of the most potent power-generating groups in all history.", " But the action of the scientists, since it acts into nature from the standpoint of the universe and not into the web of human relationships, lacks the revelatory character of action as well as the ability to produce stories and become historical, which together form the very source from which meaningfulness springs into and illuminates human existence.", " In this existentially most important aspect, action, too, has become an experience for the privileged few, and these few who still know what it means to act may well be even fewer than the artists, their experience even rarer than the genuine experience of and love for the world.", " Thought, finally \u2014 which we, following the premodern as well as the modern tradition, omitted from our reconsideration of the vita activa \u2014 is still possible, and no doubt actual, wherever men live under the conditions of political freedom.", " Unfortunately, and contrary to what is currently assumed about the proverbial ivorytower independence of thinkers, no other human capacity is so vulnerable, and it is in fact far easier to act under conditions of tyranny than it is to think.", " As a living experience, thought has always been assumed, perhaps wrongly, to be known only to the few.", " It may not be presumptuous to believe that these few have not become fewer in our time.", " This may be irrelevant, or of restricted relevance, for the future of the world; it is not irrelevant The Vita Activa and the Modern Age for the future of man.", " For if no other test but the experience of being active, no other measure but the extent of sheer activity were to be applied to the various activities within the vita activa , it might well be that thinking as such would surpass them all.", " Whoever has any experience in this matter will know how right Cato was when he said: Numquam se plus agere quam nihil cum ageret , numquam minus solum esse quam cum solus esset \u2014 \u201cNever is he more active than when he does nothing, never is he less alone than when he is by himself.", "\u201d."]
